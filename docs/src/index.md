# RHEOS.jl Documentation

RHEOS, an abbreviation of Rheology Open Source, is a Julia package which provides tools for analysis of rheology data and generation of new viscoelastic models. It features a large array of standard and fractional linear viscoelastic models - new ones can be easily added by the user. It can also be used as an educational tool to demonstrate the qualitative behaviour of various viscoelastic models. 

# Installation

From within the Julia v0.6.3 REPL, type:

```Pkg.clone("https://github.com/rheos-cambridge/RHEOS.jl.git")```

Then, from within the RHEOS directory in your Julia library (or just downloaded from the Github seperately), run:
