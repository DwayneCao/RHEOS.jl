  volume = {7},

  issn = {2045-2322},
  abstract = {Force-displacement (F-Z) curves are the most commonly used Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) mode to measure the local, nanoscale elastic properties of soft materials like living cells. Yet a theoretical framework has been lacking that allows the post-processing of F-Z data to extract their viscoelastic constitutive parameters. Here, we propose a new method to extract nanoscale viscoelastic properties of soft samples like living cells and hydrogels directly from conventional AFM F-Z experiments, thereby creating a common platform for the analysis of cell elastic and viscoelastic properties with arbitrary linear constitutive relations. The method based on the elastic-viscoelastic correspondence principle was validated using finite element (FE) simulations and by comparison with the existed AFM techniques on living cells and hydrogels. The method also allows a discrimination of which viscoelastic relaxation model, for example, standard linear solid (SLS) or power-law rheology (PLR), best suits the experimental data. The method was used to extract the viscoelastic properties of benign and cancerous cell lines (NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, NMuMG epithelial, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells). Finally, we studied the changes in viscoelastic properties related to tumorigenesis including TGF-{$\beta$} induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition on NMuMG cells and Syk expression induced phenotype changes in MDA-MB-231 cells.},

  abstract = {At all stages, plant development results from a complex integration of multiple endogenous and environmental signals. The sedentary nature of plants strongly enhances the impact of the environment on plant development as compared to animal development. The embryonic and postembryonic seedling stem, called the hypocotyl, of the model species Arabidopsis (thale cress) has proved to be an excellent system for studying such signal interplay in the regulation of growth and developmental responses. The extension of the hypocotyl, which is regulated by a network of interacting factors, including light and plant hormones, is such a process. These regulatory factors often reciprocally regulate their biosynthesis and/or signalling. Here we present the current state of knowledge about the regulation of hypocotyl growth by a large repertoire of internal and external cues. BioEssays 27:275\textendash{}284, 2005.},

Cell walls provide plants with strength and protection, and also represent the most abundant source of renewable biomass. Despite the importance of plant cell walls, comparatively little is known about the identities of genes and functions of proteins involved in their biosynthesis. The model plant Arabidopsis and the availability of its genome sequence have been invaluable for the identification and functional characterization of genes encoding enzymes involved in plant cell-wall biosynthesis. This review covers recent progress in the identification and characterization of genes encoding proteins involved in the biosynthesis of Arabidopsis cell-wall polysaccharides and arabinogalactan proteins. These studies have improved our understanding of both the mechanisms of cell-wall biosynthesis and the functions of various cell-wall polymers, and have highlighted areas where further research is needed.},

  abstract = {Purpose It is well known that pathological changes in tissue alter its mechanical properties. This holds also true for brain tissue. In case of the brain, however, obtaining information about these properties is hard due to the surrounding cranial bone. In this paper a novel technique to create an imaging contrast based on the aforementioned properties is presented. Methods The method is based on an excitation of the brain induced by a short fall. The response of the brain tissue is measured using a motion sensitive MRI sequence. Results The new method is tested by measurements on phantom material as well as on healthy volunteers. In a proof of principle experiment the capability of the approach to identify local alterations in the mechanical properties is shown by means of measurements on meningioma patients. Conclusion The presented results show the feasibility of the novel method. Even in this early state of the proposed method, comparisons of measurements on meningioma patients with intraoperative palpation suggest that meningioma tissue responds differently to the excitation depending on their mechanical properties.

Biosynthesis and in muro modification of homogalacturonan have recently emerged as key determinants of plant development, controlling cell adhesion, organ development, and phyllotactic patterning. This review will focus on recent findings regarding impact of homogalacturonan content and methyl-esterification status of this polymer on plant life. De-methyl-esterification of homogalacturonan occurs through the action of the ubiquitous enzyme `pectin methyl-esterase'. We here describe various strategies developed by the plant to finely tune the methyl-esterification status of homogalacturonan along key events of the plant lifecycle.},

STW-A dispersions at 3, 5, and 8\% (w/w) showed low apparent viscosities, shear-thinning and liquid-like behaviors. They were well fitted using the Ostwald\textendash{}de Waele model and obey the Cox\textendash{}Merz rule. The viscosity and the viscoelastic behavior were greatly modified by the presence of sucrose. STW-A at 1\% (+ sucrose) showed shearthinning and concentrated solution behavior. Pronounced shear-thinning and gel-like behaviors were obtained with STW-A at 2 and 3\% (+ sucrose). Their flow curves profiles were better fitted using the Hershel\textendash{}Bulkley model and not followed the Cox and Merz rule. Temperature sweeps (5\textendash{}80{$\smwhtcircle$}C) showed that STW-A formed thermostable gels.

  abstract = {Citrus peel is the preferred raw material for pectin production, mainly due to its high pectin content but also due to the gelling capabilities. Especially the high galacturonic acid content and the high degree of methyl esterification make it an attractive starting material for further modification. Until now the presence of rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I) in commercial pectin has received less attention due to its relatively low abundance. Using a gentle industrial extraction process we discovered a slightly higher composition in neutral sugars of RG-I. In particular, the arabinose concentration in mildly extracted pectin was higher compared to conventionally extracted pectin. The use of enzymes specific for either arabinan or galactan allowed assessing the implications of varying neutral sugar composition on the gelling capabilities of pectin. A comparison between untreated and debranched pectin revealed a significant decrease in both gelling temperature (up to 20  C) and gel strength (up to 38\%), following the specific reduction in neutral sugars concentration. Coil-overlap and entanglement effects were analysed to further understand the impact of RG-I side chains on polymer rheology.},

The TEM images of the mixed gels revealed a coarse, strand-like network with pores in the range of microns, independent of the ratio and the composition of the samples.

  abstract = {The extension of the Johnson\textendash{}Kendall\textendash{}Roberts (JKR) theory of elastic contact to a linear viscoelastic material is addressed with particular emphasis on the debonding phase of a JKR test. We show that the contact stress at the moving edge of the contact zone is tensile and is characterized by a stress intensity factor, KI (t). In contrast to the elastic JKR theory, KI (t) is no longer determined by the current contact area and applied load, but depends on the entire history of loading. Furthermore, KI (t) no longer uniquely determines the energy flow (G) to the material at the moving edge of the contact zone since G is coupled to the local separation or bonding process. This means that one cannot obtain the work of adhesion (W ) directly from experimental data. Since the mechanics of viscoelastic deformation is invariably coupled to the separation or bonding process, the adhesion of viscoelastic bodies can no longer be completely characterized by a single parameter (i.e. W ) approach. The theory presented here suggests that a better way to characterize the adhesion of viscoelastic materials is to relate the rate of bonding or debonding of surfaces to the KI (t). Procedures for obtaining KI (t) from experimental data are given for the bonding and debonding phases of both force and displacement controlled tests.},

This result contradicts the assumption of the cell membrane as the constraining element in osmotic stress but is consistent with the cytoskeleton acting as a cross-linked gel.

  abstract = {The atomic force microscope (AFM) has found wide applicability as a nanoindentation tool to measure local elastic properties of soft materials. An automated approach to the processing of AFM indentation data, namely, the extraction of Young's modulus, is essential to realizing the high-throughput potential of the instrument as an elasticity probe for typical soft materials that exhibit inhomogeneity at microscopic scales. This paper focuses on Hertzian analysis techniques, which are applicable to linear elastic indentation. We compiled a series of synergistic strategies into an algorithm that overcomes many of the complications that have previously impeded efforts to automate the fitting of contact mechanics models to indentation data. AFM raster data sets containing up to 1024 individual force-displacement curves and macroscopic compression data were obtained from testing polyvinyl alcohol gels of known composition. Local elastic properties of tissue-engineered cartilage were also measured by the AFM. All AFM data sets were processed using customized software based on the algorithm, and the extracted values of Young's modulus were compared to those obtained by macroscopic testing. Accuracy of the technique was verified by the good agreement between values of Young's modulus obtained by AFM and by direct compression of the synthetic gels. Validation of robustness was achieved by successfully fitting the vastly different types of force curves generated from the indentation of tissue-engineered cartilage. For AFM indentation data that are amenable to Hertzian analysis, the method presented here minimizes subjectivity in preprocessing and allows for improved consistency and minimized user intervention. Automated, large-scale analysis of indentation data holds tremendous potential in bioengineering applications, such as high-resolution elasticity mapping of natural and artificial tissues.},

Since, in general, the contact region varies with time, this lends to a problem which cannot be treated directly by application of the Laplace transform, which has formed the basis for most published viscoelastic stress-distribution solutions. It is shown that the solution of the viscoelastic counterpart of the Hertz problem in elasticity can, however, be deduced from the elastic solution. A particular example is presented, and the marked effect of viscoelastic behavior on the pressure distribution in the contact region is illustrated. The problem also illustrates the tentative nature of the method of approach and the need for a separate confirmation of the solution. The solution is presented for general linear viscoelastic operators and offers the possibility of determining these from a contact test.},

  abstract = {This treatise is concerned with the stresses and deformation of solid bodies in contact with each other, along curved surfaces which touch initially at a point or along a line. Examples are a railway wheel and rail, or a pair of gear wheel teeth. Professor Johnson first reviews the development of the theory of contact stresses since the problem was originally addressed by H. Hertz in 1882. Next he discusses the influence of friction and the topographical roughness of surfaces, and this is incorporated into the theory of contact mechanics. An important feature is the treatment of bodies which deform plastically or viscoelastically. In addition to stationary contact, an appreciable section of the book is concerned with bodies which are in sliding or rolling contact, or which collide.},

  volume = {344},
  issn = {00086215},
  abstract = {Many of the functional attributes of pectin, whether in the plant cell wall or in engineered food materials, are linked to its gelling properties and in particular to its ability to assemble in the presence of calcium. Pectin's fine structure and local concentration relative to that of its cross-linking ion play a major role in determining resultant gel micro-structures, and consequently the mechanical and transport properties of pectin matrices. Recent studies have sought to probe the basic properties of such calcium-induced matrices, using a light scattering technique called diffusing wave spectroscopy (DWS). In addition to the low frequency mechanical behaviour, which provides information about the nature and density of cross-links, microrheological measurements carried out with DWS are able to determine the high frequency behaviour, which is closely linked to the response of the basic strands of the network. By using these microrheological measurements, two distinct regimes have been identified into which pectin gels appear to fall: one corresponding to the presence of semi-flexible networks, a generally accepted paradigm in biological gels, and another where flexible networks dominate. In order to explain the origin of these dramatically different networks, distinct assembly pathways have been proposed in which the relative importance of the free energy gained by association and the frictional barrier to polymeric re-arrangement during network formation can differ significantly. By manipulating the local environment in the plant cell wall it is possible that Nature makes full use of both of these network types for fulfilling different tasks; such as providing strain-hardening, maximizing local elastic properties or controlling macromolecular transport. {\'O} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Here we investigated the question whether cells, being highly heterogeneous objects, could be described with the elastic modulus (effective Young's modulus) in a self-consistent way. We performed a comparative analysis of the elastic modulus derived from the indentation data obtained with atomic force microscopy (AFM) on human cervical epithelial cells (both normal and cancerous). Both sharp (cone) and dull (2500-nm radius sphere) AFM probes were used. The indentation data were processed through different elastic models. The cell was approximated as a homogeneous elastic medium that had either 1), smooth hemispherical boundary (Hertz/Sneddon models) or 2), the boundary covered with a layer of glycocalyx and membrane protrusions (``brush'' models). Consistency of these approximations was investigated. Specifically, we tested the independence of the elastic modulus of the indentation depth, which is assumed in these models. We demonstrated that only one model showed consistency in treating cells as a homogeneous elastic medium, namely, the brush model, when processing the indentation data collected with the dull AFM probe. The elastic modulus demonstrated strong depth dependence in all models: Hertz/Sneddon models (no brush taken into account), and when the brush model was applied to the data collected with sharp conical probes. We conclude that it is possible to describe the elastic properties of the cell body by means of an effective elastic modulus, used in a self-consistent way, when using the brush model to analyze data collected with a dull AFM probe. The nature of these results is discussed.},

The traditional methods for describing the dynamics of this network are extremely complicated. The mechanical properties of a cell reflect the cytoskeletal structure and composition and are closely related to the cellular biological functions and physiological activities. Therefore, modeling the mechanical properties of single cells provides the basis for analyzing and controlling the cellular state. In this study, we developed a dynamical model with cellular viscoelasticity properties as the system parameters to describe the stress-relaxation phenomenon of a single cell indented by an atomic force microscope (AFM). The system order and parameters were identified and analyzed. Our results demonstrated that the parameters identified using this model represent the cellular mechanical elasticity and viscosity and can be used to classify cell types.},

Their mathematical elegance allows for common tasks such as numerical differentiation to be computed efficiently on large data sets. Efficient computation of convolutions is critical to artificial intelligence in real-time applications, like machine vision, where convolutions must be continuously and efficiently computed on tens to hundreds of kilobytes per second. In this paper, we explore how convolutions are used in fundamental machine vision applications. We present an accelerated n-dimensional convolution package in the high performance computing language, Julia, and demonstrate its efficacy in solving the time to contact problem for machine vision. Results are measured against synthetically generated videos and quantitatively assessed according to their mean squared error from the ground truth. We achieve over an order of magnitude decrease in compute time and allocated memory for comparable machine vision applications. All code is packaged and integrated into the official Julia Package Manager to be used in various other scenarios.},

  volume = {217},
  issn = {0001-5970, 1619-6937},
  abstract = {Wood is an anisotropic, hierarchically organized material, and the question how the hierarchical organization governs the anisotropy of its mechanical properties (such as stiffness and strength) has kept researchers busy for decades. While the honeycomb structure of softwood or the chemical composition of the cell wall has been fairly well established, the mechanical role of the cell wall water is less understood. The question arises how its capability to carry compressive loads (but not tensile loads) and its pressurization state affect mechanical deformations of the hierarchical composite ``wood''. By extending the framework of poro-micromechanics to more than two material phases, we here provide corresponding answers from a novel hierarchical set of matrix-inclusion problems with eigenstresses: (i) Biot tensors, expressing how much of the cell wall water-induced pore pressure is transferred to the boundary of an overall deformation-free representative volume element (RVE), and (ii) Biot moduli, expressing the porosity changes invoked by a pore pressure within such an RVE, are reported as functions of the material's composition, in particular of its water content and its lumen space. At the level of softwood, where we transform a periodic homogenization scheme into an equivalent matrix-inclusion problem, all Biot tensor components are found to increase with decreasing lumen volume fraction. A further research finding concerns the strong anisotropy of the Biot tensor with respect to the water content: Transverse components increase with increasing water content, while the relationship ``longitudinal Biot tensor component versus volume fraction of water within the wood cell wall'' exhibits a maximum, representing a trade-off between pore pressure increase (increasing the longitudinal Biot tensor component, dominantly at low water content) and softening of the cell wall (reducing this component, dominantly at high water contents). Soft cell wall matrices reinforced with very stiff cellulose fibers may even result in negative longitudinal Biot tensor components. The aforementioned maximum effect is also noted for the Biot modulus.},

  abstract = {Viscoelasticity and poroelasticity commonly coexist as time-dependent behaviors in polymer gels. Engineering applications often require knowledge of both behaviors separated; however, few methods exist to decouple viscoelastic and poroelastic properties of gels. We propose a method capable of separating viscoelasticity and poroelasticity of gels in various mechanical tests. The viscoelastic characteristic time and the poroelastic diffusivity of a gel define an intrinsic material length scale of the gel. The experimental setup gives a sample length scale, over which the solvent migrates in the gel. By setting the sample length to be much larger or smaller than the material length, the viscoelasticity and poroelasticity of the gel will dominate at different time scales in a test. Therefore, the viscoelastic and poroelastic properties of the gel can be probed separately at different time scales of the test. We further validate the method by finite-element models and stress-relaxation experiments.},

  abstract = {Alterations in the biomechanical properties and cytoskeletal organization of cancer cells in addition to genetic changes have been correlated with their aggressive phenotype. In this study, we investigated changes in the viscoelasticity of mouse ovarian surface epithelial (MOSE) cells, a mouse model for progressive ovarian cancer. We demonstrate that the elasticity of late-stage MOSE cells (0.549 {$\pm$} 0.281 kPa) were significantly less than that of their early-stage counterparts (1.097 {$\pm$} 0.632 kPa). Apparent cell viscosity also decreased significantly from early (144.7 {$\pm$} 102.4 Pa-s) to late stage (50.74 {$\pm$} 29.72 Pa-s). This indicates that ovarian cells are stiffer and more viscous when they are benign. The increase in cell deformability directly correlates with the progression of a transformed phenotype from a nontumorigenic, benign cell to a tumorigenic, malignant one. The decrease in the level of actin in the cytoskeleton and its organization is directly associated with the changes in cell biomechanical property.},

Naive mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are shown here to specify lineage and commit to phenotypes with extreme sensitivity to tissuelevel elasticity. Soft matrices that mimic brain are neurogenic, stiffer matrices that mimic muscle are myogenic, and comparatively rigid matrices that mimic collagenous bone prove osteogenic. During the initial week in culture, reprogramming of these lineages is possible with addition of soluble induction factors, but after several weeks in culture, the cells commit to the lineage specified by matrix elasticity, consistent with the elasticity-insensitive commitment of differentiated cell types. Inhibition of nonmuscle myosin II blocks all elasticitydirected lineage specification\textendash{}without strongly perturbing many other aspects of cell function and shape. The results have significant implications for understanding physical effects of the in vivo microenvironment and also for therapeutic uses of stem cells.},

  shorttitle = {Visco-Elastic Behavior through Fractional Calculus},
  abstract = {In capturing visco-elastic behavior, experimental tests play a fundamental rule, since they allow to build up theoretical constitutive laws very useful for simulating their own behavior. The main challenge is representing the visco-elastic materials through simple models, in order to spread their use. However, the wide used models for capturing both relaxation and creep tests are combinations of simple models as Maxwell and/or Kelvin, that depend on several parameters for fitting both creep and relaxation tests. This paper, following Nutting and Gemant idea of fitting experimental data through a power law function, aims at stressing the validity of fractional model. In fact, as soon as relaxation test is well fitted by power law decay then the fractional constitutive law involving Caputo's derivative directly appears. It will be shown that fractional model is proper for studying visco-elastic behavior, since it may capture both relaxation and creep tests, requiring the identification of two parameters only. This consideration is assessed by the good agreement between experimental tests on creep and relaxation and the fractional model proposed. Experimental tests, here reported are performed on two polymers having different chemical physical properties such that the fractional model may cover a wide range of visco-elastic behavior. {\'O} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {In this work we present a unified method to study the mechanical properties of cells using the atomic force microscope. Stress relaxation and creep compliance measurements permitted us to determine, the relaxation times, the Young moduli and the viscosity of breast cancer cells (MCF-7). The results show that the mechanical behaviour of MCF-7 cells responds to a two-layered model of similar elasticity but differing viscosity. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with an actin-depolymerising agent results in an overall decrease in both cell elasticity and viscosity, however to a different extent for each layer. The layer that undergoes the smaller decrease (36\textendash{}38\%) is assigned to the cell membrane/cortex while the layer that experiences the larger decrease (70\textendash{}80\%) is attributed to the cell cytoplasm. The combination of the method presented in this work, together with the approach based on stress relaxation microscopy (Moreno-Flores et al 2010 J. Biomech. 43 349\textendash{}54), constitutes a unique AFM-based experimental framework to study cell mechanics. This methodology can also be extended to study the mechanical properties of biomaterials in general.},

This has been formalized by the Lockhart equation, which can be derived from the physical laws of the deformation of viscoelastic materials. However, the experimental evidence for such a direct correlation between growth rate and turgor is inconclusive. This has led to challenges of the Lockhart model. We model the oscillatory growth of pollen tubes to investigate this relationship. We couple the Lockhart equation to the dynamical equations for the change in material properties. We find that the correct implementation of the Lockhart equation within a feedback loop leading to low amplitude oscillatory growth predicts that in this system changes in the global turgor do not influence the average growth rate in a linear manner, consistent with experimental observations. An analytic analysis of our model demonstrates in which regime the average growth rate becomes uncorrelated from the turgor pressure.},

\$e\_\textbackslash{}alpha(t) := E\_\textbackslash{}alpha(-t\^\textbackslash{}alpha)\$  for \$0{$<\backslash$}alpha{$<$}1\$ and \$t{$>$}0\$, which  is known to
 be completely monotone (CM)  with a non-negative spectrum of frequencies and times,
suitable to model fractional relaxation processes.
 We first note that (surprisingly)  these two spectra coincide so providing
a universal scaling  property of  this function, not  well pointed out in the literature.
Furthermore, we consider  the problem of approximating our  M-L  function  with simpler CM  functions for small and large times.
We provide two different sets of elementary CM functions that are asymptotically  equivalent to \$e\_\textbackslash{}alpha(t)\$
as \$t\textbackslash{}to 0\$ and \$t\textbackslash{}to +\textbackslash{}infty\$.
The first set is given by the stretched exponential for small times
and the power law for large times, following a standard approach.
For the second set we chose  two rational CM functions in \$t\^\textbackslash{}alpha\$,
obtained as the  Pad\textbackslash{}`e  Approximants  (PA)  \$[0/1]\$  to the convergent series in positive powers  (as \$t\textbackslash{}to 0\$)
and to the asymptotic series in negative powers  (as \$t\textbackslash{}to \textbackslash{}infty\$),  respectively.
From numerical computations we are allowed to the conjecture that the second set provides upper and lower bounds to the Mittag-Leffler function.},

This is problematic, as many different data distributions can lead to the same bar or line graph. The full data may suggest different conclusions from the summary statistics. We recommend training investigators in data presentation, encouraging a more complete presentation of data, and changing journal editorial policies.

Thinking about the title early\textemdash{}and regularly returning to hone it\textemdash{}can help not only the writing of the paper but also the process of designing experiments or developing theories. This Rule of One is the most difficult rule to optimally implement because it comes face-toface with the key challenge of science, which is to make the claim and/or model as simple as the data and logic can support but no simpler. In the end, your struggle to find this balance may appropriately result in ``one contribution'' that is multifaceted. For example, a technology paper may describe both its new technology and a biological result using it; the bridge that unifies these two facets is a clear description of how the new technology can be used to do new biology.},

A mild treatment with pectinase apparently enlarged the channels, without adversely affecting cell viability, enabling significantly larger molecules to pass through the wall. Treatment of the cells with cellulysin or protease did not have this enlargement effect. It appears that the organization of pectic substances is a major control element in defining the sieving properties of the wall.},

  abstract = {An elastomeric gel is a mixture of a polymer network and a solvent. In response to changes in mechanical forces and in the chemical potential of the solvent in the environment, the gel evolves by two concurrent molecular processes: the conformational change of the network, and the migration of the solvent. The two processes result in viscoelasticity and poroelasticity, and are characterized by two material-specific properties: the time of viscoelastic relaxation and the effective diffusivity of the solvent through the network. The two properties define a materialspecific length. The material-specific time and length enable us to discuss macroscopic observations made over different lengths and times, and identify limiting conditions in which viscoelastic and poroelastic relaxations have either completed or yet started. We formulate a model of homogeneous deformation, and use several examples to illustrate viscoelasticity-limited solvent migration, where the migration of the solvent is pronounced, but the size of the gel is so small that the rate of change is limited by viscoelasticity. We further describe a theory that evolves a gel through inhomogeneous states. Both infinitesimal and finite deformation are considered.},

The complexity and diversity of the structure of rhamnogalacturonans I are the rea sons for the limited information about the properties and supramolecular organization of these polysaccharides, including the relationship between these parameters and the functions of rhamnogalacturonans I in plant cells. In the present work, on the example of rhamnogalacturonan I from flax gelatinous fibers, the ability of this type of pectic polysaccharides to form at physiological concentrations hydrogels with hyperelastic properties was revealed for the first time. According to IR spec troscopy, water molecules are more tightly retained in the gelling rhamnogalacturonan I from flax fiber cell wall in compar ison with the non gelling rhamnogalacturonan I from primary cell wall of potato. With increase in strength of water bind ing by rhamnogalacturonan I, there is an increase in elastic modulus and decrease in Poisson's ratio of gel formed by this polysaccharide. The model of hyperelastic rhamnogalacturonan I capture by laterally interacting cellulose microfibrils, con structed using the finite element method, confirmed the suitability of rhamnogalacturonan I gel with the established prop erties for the function in the gelatinous cell wall, allowing consideration of this tissue and stage specific pectic polysac charide as an important factor in creation of gelatinous fiber contractility.},

They have been used as scaffolds for tissue engineering, as delivery vehicles for drugs, and as model extracellular matrices for basic biological studies. These applications require tight control of a number of material properties including mechanical stiffness, swelling, degradation, cell attachment, and binding or release of bioactive molecules. Control over these properties can be achieved by chemical or physical modifications of the polysaccharide itself or the gels formed from alginate. The utility of these modified alginate gels as biomaterials has been demonstrated in a number of in vitro and in vivo studies.

  abstract = {Mechanical effects of turgor pressure on cell walls were simulated by deforming cell wall analogues based on Acetobacter xylinus cellulose under equi-biaxial tension. This experimental set-up, with associated modelling, allowed quantitative information to be obtained on cellulose alone and in composites with pectin and/or xyloglucan. Cellulose was the main load-bearing component, pectin and xyloglucan leading to a decrease in modulus when incorporated. The cellulose-only system could be regarded as an essentially linear elastic material with a modulus ranging from 200 to 500 MPa. Pectin incorporation modified extensibility properties of the system by topology/architecture changes of cellulose fibril assemblies, but the cellulose/pectin composites could still be described as a linear elastic material with a modulus ranging from 120 to 250 MPa. The xyloglucan/ cellulose composite could not be modelled as a linear elastic material. Introducing xyloglucan into a cellulose network or a cellulose/pectin composite led to very compliant materials characterised by time-dependent creep behaviour. Modulus values obtained for the composite materials were compared with mechanical data found for plant-derived systems. After comparing bi-axial and uni-axial behaviour of the different composites, structural models were proposed to explain the role of each polysaccharide in determining the mechanical properties of these plant primary cell wall analogues.},

The corresponding creep law is expressed in an integral form in which the exponential function of the Becker model is replaced and generalized by a Mittag\textendash{}Leffler function of order {$\nu$}. Then the corresponding non-dimensional creep function and its rate are studied as functions of time for different values of {$\nu$} in order to visualize the transition from the classical Maxwell body to the Becker body. Based on the hereditary theory of linear viscoelasticity, we also approximate the relaxation function by solving numerically a Volterra integral equation of the second kind. In turn, the relaxation function is shown versus time for different values of {$\nu$} to visualize again the transition from the classical Maxwell body to the Becker body. Furthermore, we provide a full characterization of the new model by computing, in addition to the creep and relaxation functions, the so-called specific dissipation Q-1 as a function of frequency, which is of particular relevance for geophysical applications.},

Energy dissipation is studied, and in particular the frequency dependence of the loss tangent, which is found to be flat over a large number of cycles if the damping is small, in accordance with observed behavior of structural materials and unlike the usual (Kelvin) model of structural damping. An approximation to the modified model based on a discrete retardation-time spectrum, called the discrete modified Kuhn model, is also studied; this is an internal-variable model which can be extended to account for nonlinear behavior. In contrast to existing rheological models, in the proposed model the number of parameters is fixed and does not depend on the number of rheological elements needed to simulate experimental results.},

  abstract = {Pectins are fundamental polysaccharides in the plant primary cell wall. Pectins are synthesized and secreted to cell walls as highly methyl-esterified polymers and then demethyl-esterified by pectin methylesterases (PMEs), which are spatially regulated by pectin methylesterase inhibitors (PMEIs). Although PME and PMEI genes are pivotal in plant cell wall formation, few studies have focused on the evolutionary patterns of the PME and PMEI gene families. In this study, the gene origin, evolution, and expression diversity of these two families were systematically analyzed using 11 representative species, including algae, bryophytes, lycophytes and flowering land plants. The results show that 1) for the two subfamilies (PME and proPME) of PME, the origin of the PME subfamily is consistent with the appearance of pectins in early charophyte cell walls, 2) Whole genome duplication (WGD) and tandem duplication contribute to the expansion of proPME and PMEI families in land plants, 3) Evidence of selection pressure shows that the proPME and PMEI families have rapidly evolved, particularly the PMEI family in vascular plants, and 4) Comparative expression profile analysis of the two families indicates that the eudicot Arabidopsis and monocot rice have different expression patterns. In addition, the gene structure and sequence analyses show that the origin of the PMEI domain may be derived from the neofunctionalization of the pro domain after WGD. This study will advance the evolutionary understanding of the PME and PMEI families and plant cell wall development.},

Using membership categorisation analysis, we show that the media discourse about authentic leadership was both ambiguous and ambivalent.

We propose that this complex and contradictory discursive landscape is also relevant in business contexts where `ethical' leaders are subjected to praise for their virtues but also criticism for their ineffectiveness. Future research could usefully study how `ethical' leaders in different settings can be subject to competing evaluations when their ethical values are discursively contrasted to expectations concerning what it takes to be an `effective' leader.},

  shorttitle = {Fractal Network Dimension and Viscoelastic Powerlaw Behavior},
  abstract = {Recent advances in dynamic elastography and biorheology have revealed that the complex shear modulus, G{${_\ast}$}, of various biological soft tissues obeys a frequency-dependent powerlaw. This viscoelastic powerlaw behavior implies that mechanical properties are communicated in tissue across the continuum of scales from microscopic to macroscopic. For deriving constitutive constants from the dispersion of G{${_\ast}$} in a biological tissue, a hierarchical fractal model is introduced that accounts for multiscale networks. Effective-media powerlaw constants are derived by a constitutive law based on cross-linked viscoelastic clusters embedded in a rigid environment. The spatial variation of G{${_\ast}$} is considered at each level of hierarchy by an iterative coarse-graining procedure. The establishment of cross-links in this model network is associated with an increasing fractal dimension and an increasing viscoelastic powerlaw exponent. This fundamental relationship between shear modulus dynamics and fractal dimension of the mechanical network in tissue is experimentally reproduced in phantoms by applying shear oscillatory rheometry to layers of tangled paper strips embedded in agarose gel. Both model and experiments demonstrate the sensitivity of G{${_\ast}$} to the density of the mechanical network in tissue, corroborating disease-related alterations of the viscoelastic powerlaw exponent in human parenchyma demonstrated by in vivo elastography.},

Load-controlled spherical indentation with a ramp-hold creep profile is considered. The identification approach is based on the normalization of the time-displacement indentation response, in analogy to the well-known one-dimensional consolidation problem. The identification algorithm consists of two nested optimization routines, one in the time-displacement domain and the other in a normalized domain. The procedure is validated by identifying poroelastic parameters from the displacement-time outputs of finite element simulations; the new identification scheme proves both quantitatively reliable and fast. The procedure is also tested on the identification of the constitutive parameters of gelatin gel and bone from experimental indentation data and succeeds in providing quantitative results almost in real time.},

  abstract = {Microsphere sintering method was used to fabricate bone tissue engineering scaffolds made of polycaprolactone (PCL)/bioactive glass 58S5Z (58S modified with 5 wt\% Zinc). First, the effect of PCL/58S5Z ratio on the mechanical properties (elastic modulus and yield strength) was investigated. It was found that samples with 5 wt\% 58S5Z (named 5\%BG) had the highest elastic modulus and yield strength among all samples, i.e., with 0, 5, 10, and 20 wt\% bioactive glass. Then, considering the importance of viscoelastic properties of bone, the viscoelastic behavior of 0\%BG (scaffold with only PCL) and 5\%BG samples was determined by performing compressive stress relaxation test and subsequently a Generalized Maxwell model was developed. Findings indicated a similar amount and pattern of predicted storage and loss moduli and loss factor of the composite scaffolds to those of the bone. In the next step, the analysis of biological behavior of the scaffolds using MTT assay, DAPI and Alizarin red staining demonstrated that 5\%BG scaffolds had higher in vitro cell viability and bone formation compared to 0\%BG ones. Furthermore, in vivo study employing H\&E staining of the scaffolds implanted in rats' calvarium for 50 days, confirmed the earlier findings and showed that 5\%BG-filled defects had higher and more uniform bone formation compared to both 0\%BG-filled and empty defects.},

  abstract = {Understanding the viscoelastic behavior of collagenous tissues with complex hierarchical structures requires knowledge of the properties at each structural level. Whole tissues have been studied extensively, but less is known about the mechanical behavior at the submicron, fibrillar level. Using a microelectromechanical systems platform, in~vitro coupled creep and stress relaxation tests were performed on collagen fibrils isolated from the sea cucumber dermis. Stress-strain-time data indicate that isolated fibrils exhibit viscoelastic behavior that could be fitted using the Maxwell-Weichert model. The fibrils showed an elastic modulus of 123 {$\pm$} 46 MPa. The time-dependent behavior was well fit using the two-time-constant Maxwell-Weichert model with a fast time response of 7 {$\pm$} 2~s and a slow time response of 102 {$\pm$} 5 s. The fibrillar relaxation time was smaller than literature values for tissue-level relaxation time, suggesting that tissue relaxation is dominated by noncollagenous components (e.g., proteoglycans). Each specimen was tested three times, and the only statistically significant difference found was that the elastic modulus is larger in the first test than in the subsequent two tests, indicating that viscous properties of collagen fibrils are not sensitive to the history of previous tests.},

During mate search, both sexes should mutually optimize their encounters, thus raising a question of how they achieve this. Here, we show that a population with sexually dimorphic movement patterns achieves the highest individual mating success under a limited lifespan. Extensive simulations found and analytical approximations corroborated the existence of conditions under which sexual dimorphism in the movement patterns (i.e. how diffusively they move) is advantageous over sexual monomorphism. Mutual searchers with limited lifespans need to balance the speed and accuracy of finding their mates, and dimorphic movements can solve this trade-off. We further demonstrate that the sexual dimorphism can evolve from an initial sexually monomorphic population. Our results emphasize the importance of considering mutual optimization in problems of random search.},

  volume = {43},
  issn = {0144-8617},
  abstract = {This study deals with the effect of methyl esters, acetyl groups, and neutral sugar side-chains on the gelation properties of sugar beet pectin with Ca2+. Sugar beet pectin was treated in the presence of Ca2+ with the enzymes pectin methyl esterase (PE), pectin acetyl esterase (PAE), rhamnogalacturonan acetyl esterase (RGAE), arabinofuranosidase B (AF) and rhamnogalacturonase (RGase) in various combinations. Addition of RGAE plus PE or PAE plus PE to the pectin\textendash{}Ca2+ mixture significantly increased the release of acetyl groups and methyl esters, in comparison to the addition of only PE or PAE. This indicates that PE activity is hindered by the presence of acetyl groups both in the `smooth' and in the `hairy' regions. Also the PAE activity is hindered by the presence of methyl groups in the `smooth' regions. Treatment with PAE plus PE led to a stiffer gel, as determined by the storage modulus (G{${'}$}), than treatment with PE alone, while RGAE plus PE did not improve the gel forming properties. Addition of only PAE to the pectin\textendash{}Ca2+ mixture did not result in gel formation. A lower stiffness of the gel was found when RGase combined with RGAE and PE were added to the pectin\textendash{}Ca2+ mixture, in comparison to treatment with PE alone. Addition of AF plus PE to the pectin\textendash{}Ca2+ mixture gave similar rheological effects as treatment with only PE. A fraction representing the `smooth' homogalacturonan regions, which was obtained after treatment of the beet pectin with RGase and subsequent size-exclusion chromatography, was also able to form a gel with Ca2+ and PE. However, the gel formation was much slower, and the stiffness of the gel was lower than when the parental extract was used. Also with the modified pectin the treatment with PAE plus PE gave an increased stiffness of the gel in comparison to PE alone.},

  volume = {155},
  issn = {0022-2836},
  shorttitle = {Conformations and Interactions of Pectins},
  abstract = {In the accompanying paper (Morris et al., 1982) we present evidence of Ca2+-induced association of poly-d-galacturonate sequences from pectin into dimers of 21 chain symmetry, with co-operative (``egg-box'') binding of Ca2+ on specific sites along the interior faces of each chain. We now investigate the role in calcium pectate gel networks of other structural features, in particular methyl esterification and 1,2-linked l-rhamnosyl residues in the polymer backbone. Acid hydrolysis of citrus, apple and sunflower pectins gave polygalacturonate blocks with a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution, and average chainlength of \textasciitilde{}25 residues in each case. Since the known relative stabilities of glycosidic linkages would lead to chain cleavage predominantly at l-rhamnose, this result indicates that the length of polygalacturonate sequences between rhamnose interruptions is approximately constant within and between the pectins studied. Calcium pectate gel strength is reduced dramatically by the incorporation of these chain segments when they are de-esterified, but not when they are esterified. This interference with the development of a network structure that resists applied stress, provides further support for our model of junction zone formation from sequences of contiguous deesterified residues, with Ca2+-mediated chain dimers providing the primary associations that can offer resistance to deformation. Samples with different levels and patterns of esterification were prepared by enzymic (blockwise) and chemical (random) de-esterification of almost fully methyl esterified pectin. In the former series, the extent of Ca2+ binding (as monitored by circular dichroism) increased almost linearly with the fraction of free carboxyl groups, whereas the latter showed a non-linear relationship of a form consistent with the requirement of this binding for blocks of contiguous non-esterified residues and, in the presence of excess univalent cations, binding was negligible when more than \textasciitilde{}40\% of the carboxyl groups were esterified. Statistical calculations of sequence length distribution at different degrees of random de-esterification show the best fit with experimental data when binding is assumed to require sequences with seven or more consecutive free carboxyl groups along the participating face of the chain. For 21 chain symmetry, this corresponds to a sequence length of 14 residues, in excellent agreement with previous independent studies of Ca2+ binding to oligogalacturonates. In the absence of competing univalent counterions, circular dichroism changes are similar in form but so large in magnitude that site-binding of Ca2+ must now go beyond the half-stoichiometry at which it is arrested in their presence. Ca2+ binding monitored by circular dichroism, and gel strength (yield stress) measured mechanically, both show a similar dependence on the pattern as well as the level of esterification, as expected for network formation by co-operative binding of Ca2+ within interchain junction zones. To fit this binding data quantitatively, it is necessary to postulate a two-stage process. (1) Initial dimerization, probably corresponding to the ``strong associations'' indicated by evidence from competitive inhibition (see above), for which a critical minimum sequence of seven residues is again required but esterified residues can now be accommodated within individual sites provided that they are paired with a free carboxylate on the complementary chain. (2) Subsequent Ca2+-induced aggregation of these preformed dimers, which can occur irrespective of the pattern of esterification on the external faces; the evidence from mechanical measurements shows that these contribute little to gel strength at high stress.},

The walls that form and partition dividing cells are modified chemically and structurally from the walls expanding to provide a cell with its functional form. In grasses, the chemical structure of the wall differs from that of all other flowering plant species that have been examined. Nevertheless, both types of wall must conform to the same physical laws. Cell expansion occurs via strictly regulated reorientation of each of the wall's components that first permits the wall to stretch in specific directions and then lock into final shape. This review integrates information on the chemical structure of individual polymers with data obtained from new techniques used to probe the arrangement of the polymers within the walls of individual cells. We provide structural models of two distinct types of walls in flowering plants consistent with the physical properties of the wall and its components.},

In this review we summarize the current level of understanding of pectin primary and tertiary structure, and describe new methods that may be useful to study localized pectin structure in the plant cell wall. We also discuss progress in our understanding of how pectin is biosynthesized and review the biological activities and possible modes of action of pectic oligosaccharides referred to as oligogalacturonides. We present our view of critical questions regarding pectin structure, biosynthesis, and function that need to be addressed in the coming decade. As the plant community works towards understanding the functions of the tens of thousands of genes expressed by plants, a large number of those genes are likely to be involved in the synthesis, turnover, biological activity, and restructuring of pectin. A combination of genetic, molecular, biochemical and chemical approaches will be necessary to fully understand the function and biosynthesis of pectin.},

  abstract = {Monoclonal antibodies recognizing un-esterified (JIM5) and methyl-esterified (JIM7) epitopes of pectin have been used to locate these epitopes by indirect immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy in the root apex of carrot (Daucus carota L.). Both antibodies labelled the walls of cells in all tissues of the developing root apex. Immunogold labelling observed at the level of the electron microscope indicated differential location of the pectin epitopes within the cell walls. The un-esterified epitope was located to the inner surface of the primary cell walls adjacent to the plasma membrane, in the middle lamella and abundantly to the outer surface at intercellular spaces. In contrast, the epitope containing methyl-esterified pectin was located evenly throughout the cell wall. In root apices of certain other species the JIM5 and JIM7 epitopes were found to be restricted to distinct tissues of the developing roots. In the root apex of oat (Avena sativa L.), JIM5 was most abundantly reactive with cell walls at the region of intercellular spaces of the cortical cells. JIM7 was reactive with cells of the cortex and the stele. Neither epitope occurred in walls of the epidermal or root-cap cells. These pattern of expression were observed to derive from the very earliest stages of the development of these tissues in the oat root meristem and were maintained in the mature root. In the coleoptile and leaf tissues of oat seedlings, JIM5 labelled all cells abundantly whereas JIM7 was unreactive. Other members of the Gramineae and also the Chenopodiaceae are shown to express similar restricted spatial patterns of distribution of these pectin epitopes in root apices.},

Earlier work by Kim and Little and the findings from this present study have demonstrated that the correspondence principle can be applied to most of the testing conditions encountered in testing of asphalt concrete. The importance of using proper analytical representation of relaxation modulus in course of calculating pseudostrain is demonstrated using the cyclic data. At the loading frequencies typically used in asphalt-concrete testing (faster than 10 Hz), the creep or relaxation data must be represented in a form that can accurately describe the short time behavior, such as the modified power law. It is concluded that the correspondence principle provides a means of more accurately modeling the damage growth and fracture healing of asphalt concrete under complex cyclic loading.},

  abstract = {The size, shape and stability of a plant depend on the flexibility and integrity of its cell walls, which, at the same time, need to allow cell expansion for growth, while maintaining mechanical stability. Biomechanical studies largely vanished from the focus of plant science with the rapid progress of genetics and molecular biology since the mid-twentieth century. However, the development of more sensitive measurement tools renewed the interest in plant biomechanics in recent years, not only to understand the fundamental concepts of growth and morphogenesis, but also with regard to economically important areas in agriculture, forestry and the paper industry. Recent advances have clearly demonstrated that mechanical forces play a crucial role in cell and organ morphogenesis, which ultimately define plant morphology. In this article, we will briefly review the available methods to determine the mechanical properties of cell walls, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) and microindentation assays, and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. But we will focus on a novel methodological approach, called cellular force microscopy (CFM), and its automated successor, real-time CFM (RT-CFM).},

This may be due to the plant's ability to compensate for the wall modification or because the biophysical method that is often employed, determination of simple elastic modulus and breakstrength, lacks the resolving power necessary for detecting subtle mechanical phenotypes. Here, we apply a method, determination of relaxation spectra, which probes, and can separate, the viscoelastic properties of different cell wall components (i.e. those properties that depend on the elastic behavior of load-bearing wall polymers combined with viscous interactions between them). A computer program, BayesRelax, that deduces relaxation spectra from appropriate rheological measurements is presented and made accessible through a Web interface. BayesRelax models the cell wall as a continuum of relaxing elements, and the ability of the method to resolve small differences in cell wall mechanical properties is demonstrated using tuber tissue from wild-type and transgenic potatoes (Solanum tuberosum) that differ in rhamnogalacturonan I side chain structure.},

  abstract = {How complex developmental-genetic networks are translated into organs with specific 3D shapes remains an open question. This question is particularly challenging because the elaboration of specific shapes is in essence a question of mechanics. In plants, this means how the genetic circuitry affects the cell wall. The mechanical properties of the wall and their spatial variation are the key factors controlling morphogenesis in plants. However, these properties are difficult to measure and investigating their relation to genetic regulation is particularly challenging. To measure spatial variation of mechanical properties, one must determine the deformation of a tissue in response to a known force with cellular resolution. Here, we present an automated confocal micro-extensometer (ACME), which greatly expands the scope of existing methods for measuring mechanical properties. Unlike classical extensometers, ACME is mounted on a confocal microscope and uses confocal images to compute the deformation of the tissue directly from biological markers, thus providing 3D cellular scale information and improved accuracy. Additionally, ACME is suitable for measuring the mechanical responses in live tissue. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that the plant hormone gibberellic acid induces a spatial gradient in mechanical properties along the length of the Arabidopsis thaliana hypocotyl.},

  abstract = {Summary
Plants are able to sense external mechanical stress, such as those due to gravity or obstacles, and alter their growth accordingly [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Like animals [9, 10], plants can also sense internal mechanical stress that plays a role in regulating their development [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. The internal mechanical stresses also known as tissue stress can result from geometry, cell type, or differential growth [19, 20, 21]. In a number of tissues, microtubules have been observed to align with mechanical stress predicted from their geometry. In the unidirectionally growing hypocotyl, the predicted tissue stresses do not reflect its cylindrical geometry. The epidermal layer experiences and resists the tensile stress coming from the expansion of the inner layers [22, 23]; this is known as the epidermal-growth-control hypothesis. Here, we use our recently developed automated confocal micro-extensometer (ACME) [24] to apply relative compressive or tensile stresses to the intact Arabidopsis hypocotyls while monitoring growth and microtubule orientation in the different layers. A finite element model revealed that under relative tension, the pattern of tissue stresses was similar to that in the intact growing hypocotyl, while when relative compression was applied, the pattern of tissue stresses was overcome and the maximum stress direction in the epidermis changed to reflect what one would predict based on the geometry of the hypocotyl. Consistent with this, the microtubules in the epidermis changed orientation under relative compression. Once the direction of stress in the epidermis was altered, the growth of the organ increased.},

  issn = {1460-2431, 0022-0957},
  abstract = {Growth in plants results from the interaction between genetic and signalling networks and the mechanical properties of cells and tissues. There has been a recent resurgence in research directed at understanding the mechanical aspects of growth, and their feedback on genetic regulation. This has been driven in part by the development of new micro-indentation techniques to measure the mechanical properties of plant cells in vivo. However, the interpretation of indentation experiments remains a challenge, since the force measures results from a combination of turgor pressure, cell wall stiffness, and cell and indenter geometry. In order to interpret the measurements, an accurate mechanical model of the experiment is required. Here, we used a plant cell system with a simple geometry, Nicotiana tabacum Bright Yellow-2 (BY-2) cells, to examine the sensitivity of micro-indentation to a variety of mechanical and experimental parameters. Using a finite-element mechanical model, we found that, for indentations of a few microns on turgid cells, the measurements were mostly sensitive to turgor pressure and the radius of the cell, and not to the exact indenter shape or elastic properties of the cell wall. By complementing indentation experiments with osmotic experiments to measure the elastic strain in turgid cells, we could fit the model to both turgor pressure and cell wall elasticity. This allowed us to interpret apparent stiffness values in terms of meaningful physical parameters that are relevant for morphogenesis.},

  abstract = {Whereas the morphogenesis of developing organisms is relatively well understood at the molecular level, the contribution of the mechanical properties of the cells to shape changes remains largely unknown, mainly because of the lack of quantified biophysical parameters at cellular or subcellular resolution. Here we designed an atomic force microscopy approach to investigate the elastic modulus of the outer cell wall in living shoot apical meristems (SAMs). SAMs are highly organized structures that contain the plant stem cells, and generate all of the aerial organs of the plant. Building on modeling and experimental data, we designed a protocol that is able to measure very local properties, i.e. within 40\textendash{}100 nm deep into the wall of living meristematic cells. We identified three levels of complexity at the meristem surface, with significant heterogeneity in stiffness at regional, cellular and even subcellular levels. Strikingly, we found that the outer cell wall was much stiffer at the tip of the meristem (5 {$\pm$} 2 MPa on average), covering the stem cell pool, than on the flanks of the meristem (1.5 {$\pm$} 0.7 MPa on average). Altogether, these results demonstrate the existence of a multiscale spatialization of the mechanical properties of the meristem surface, in addition to the previously established molecular and cytological zonation of the SAM, correlating with regional growth rate distribution.},

Complex mechanisms which are not fully understood regulate the local, individual expansion of multiple cells into an organ with a well-defined shape. Various factors of mechanical and biochemical nature play a role in the growth process. The mechanical factors include the cell wall properties, osmotic pressure, and interactions between neighboring cells. This happens under the strict restrictions stemming from geometric considerations, which are dictated by the three-dimensional shape of the leaf. In this chapter, we review this topic focusing on its geometric and mechanical aspects, such as stress\textendash{}strain response, viscous and elastic moduli, and typical statistical properties of the growth field. We view the leaf as a sheet of active matter, capable of adjusting and responding to signals originating both from its natural internal growth processes and from its surrounding. We aim at a better understanding of the growth patterns and mechanical properties of the tissue as a whole.},

However, growth is not only the result of a rigid molecular program instructing the cells precisely what to do. Local differences in growth rates between neighboring cells generate mechanical constraints that can feed back on the regulatory networks and the cytoskeleton. A number of components involved in the perception of these constraints have been identified, although their precise function remains to be determined.},

  abstract = {Mechanical properties are rarely used as quantitative indices for the large-scale mutant screening of plants, even in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The mechanical properties of plant stems generally influence their vibrational characteristics. Here, we developed Python-based software, named AraVib, for the high-throughput analysis of free vibrations of plant stems, focusing specifically on Arabidopsis stem vibrations, and its extended version, named AraVibS, to identify mutants with altered mechanical properties. These programs can be used without knowledge of Python and require only an inexpensive handmade setting stand and an iPhone/iPad with a high-speed shooting function for data acquisition. Using our system, we identified an nst1 nst3 double-mutant lacking secondary cell walls in fiber cells and a wrky12 mutant displaying ectopic formation of secondary cell wall compared with wild type by employing only two growth traits (stem height and fresh weight) in addition to videos of stem vibrations. Furthermore, we calculated the logarithmic decrement, the damping ratio, the natural frequency and the stiffness based on the spring-mass-damper model from the video data using AraVib. The stiffness was estimated to be drastically decreased in nst1 nst3, which agreed with previous tensile test results. However, in wrky12, the stiffness was significantly increased. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our new system. Because our method can be applied in a high-throughput manner, it can be used to screen for mutants with altered mechanical properties.},

  abstract = {\textbullet{} Premise of the study: Quantitative measurements of water's effects on the tension response of plant tissue will assist in understanding the regulatory mechanism underlying expansive growth. Such measurements should be multiscale in nature to account for plants' hierarchical structure. \textbullet{} Methods: Outer onion epidermal tissues were cut and bonded to uniaxial displacement-controlled mechanical loading devices to apply and measure the force on the sample. Fluorescent polystyrene beads (500 nm in diameter) were dispersed on the sample surface under various levels of tensile load conditions to obtain displacement maps with a confocal fluorescent microscope. The resulting strain was measured using a digital image correlation technique by tracking individual bead displacements. The applied forces were obtained by measuring the displacement of the calibrated force-sensing device. Tissue- and cell-scale mechanical properties were quantified by calculating the applied stress and the corresponding global and local strains. \textbullet{} Key results: The Young's modulus values of individual cell walls of dehydrated and rehydrated samples were 3.0 {$\pm$} 1.0 GPa and 0.4 {$\pm$} 0.2 GPa, respectively, and are different from the Young's modulus values of the global tissue-scale dehydrated and rehydrated samples, which were 1.9 {$\pm$} 0.3 GPa and 0.08 {$\pm$} 0.02 GPa, respectively. Poisson's ratio increased more than 3-fold due to hydration. \textbullet{} Conclusion: The results on global, cell-to-cell, and point-to-point mechanical property variations suggest the importance of the mechanical contribution of extracellular features including the middle lamella, cell shape, and dimension. This study shows that a multiscale investigation is essential for fundamental insights into the hierarchical deformation of biological systems.},

Cellulose microfibrils have hydrophobic and hydrophilic faces which may selectively bind different matrix polysaccharides and adjacent microfibrils. These distinctive binding interactions may guide partially aligned cellulose microfibrils in primary cell walls to form a planar, load-bearing network within each lamella of polylamellate walls. Consideration of expansive growth of cross-lamellate walls leads to a surprising inference: side-by-side sliding of microfibrils may be a key rate-limiting physical step, potentially targeted by specific wall loosening agents. Atomic force microscopy shows different patterns of microfibril movement during force-driven extension versus enzymatic loosening. Consequently, simulations of cell growth as elastic deformation of isotropic cell walls may need to be augmented to incorporate the distinctive behavior of growing cell walls.},

  abstract = {Nanobiomechanics of living cells is very important to understand cell\textendash{}materials interactions. This would potentially help to optimize the surface design of the implanted materials and scaffold materials for tissue engineering. The nanoindentation techniques enable quantifying nanobiomechanics of living cells, with flexibility of using indenters of different geometries. However, the data interpretation for nanoindentation of living cells is often difficult. Despite abundant experimental data reported on nanobiomechanics of living cells, there is a lack of comprehensive discussion on testing with different tip geometries, and the associated mechanical models that enable extracting the mechanical properties of living cells. Therefore, this paper discusses the strategy of selecting the right type of indenter tips and the corresponding mechanical models at given test conditions.},

  issn = {0032-5910},
  abstract = {A micromanipulation technique was used for the mechanical characterisation of two types of agarose microspheres with different material properties. Narrow-size distributions having a mean diameter in the range of 15\textendash{}22~{$\mathrm{\mu}$}m were prepared using (a) conventional emulsification followed by filtration and (b) membrane emulsification. Single microspheres were compressed to a range of deformations at different speeds up to a maximum of \textasciitilde{}70~{$\mathrm{\mu}$}m/s, and then held at constant deformation to permit relaxation to occur. It was found that the loading data could be satisfactorily described by the Hertz equation up to 30\% deformation. The Young's moduli calculated on this basis were found to correlate with the gel strength of the agarose which was used to prepare the microspheres. However, the values of the moduli increased with the compression speed and significant stress relaxation occurred. Consequently, a modified Hertz analysis was employed that accounts for the viscoelastic behaviour. Two relaxation times were sufficient to describe the stress relaxation function. The Young's moduli from the Hertz analysis corresponded to the long-time values of the stress relaxation function, which is reasonable given the relatively slow compression speeds used. The predominant process occurring at short times was ascribed to water transport from the interior of the microspheres and the process occurring at longer times was interpreted as that arising from the residual viscoelasticity of the polymer network. As a result of the stress relaxation during loading, the Tatara model could not be used to describe loading data at large deformations.},

  abstract = {Material moduli of the cytoskeleton (CSK) influence a wide range of cell functions1,2,3. There is substantial evidence from reconstituted F-actin gels that a regime exists in which the moduli scale with frequency with a universal exponent of 3/4. Such behaviour is entropic in origin and is attributable to fluctuations in semiflexible polymers driven by thermal forces4,5,6,7, but it is not obvious a priori that such entropic effects are responsible for the elasticity of the CSK. Here we demonstrate the existence of such a regime in the living cell, but only at high frequencies. Fast events scaled with frequency in a manner comparable to semiflexible-polymer dynamics, but slow events scaled with a non-universal exponent that was systematically smaller than 3/4 and probably more consistent with a soft-glass regime8,9. These findings strongly suggest that at smaller timescales elasticity arises from entropic fluctuations of a semiflexible-filament network, whereas on longer timescales slow (soft-glass-like) dynamics of a different origin prevail. The transition between these two regimes occurred on timescales of the order of 0.01 s, thus setting within the slow glassy regime cellular events such as spreading, crawling, contracting, and invading.},

  isbn = {978-0-444-82330-4},
  abstract = {This paper deals with the enzymes controlling the extent and pattern of methylesterification in pectins within the primary walls of plant cells. It also reviews the consequences of methyl-esterification for gel formation within the cell wall and for the resistance of the wall to mechanical stress. Methyl ester groups are added to pectic galacturonans by pectin methyltransferase (PMT) enzymes during pectin synthesis. Later, within the cell wall, some methyl esters may be removed by pectin methylesterase (PME) enzymes. These enzymes activities were examined in three systems, in each of which growing or dividing cells were compared with inactive cells: suspension-cultured cells of flax, mung bean hypocotyls and poplar cambium. In each system the pectins in the walls of actively growing or dividing cells were more highly methyl-esterified than those of inactive cells. Microsomal PMT activity was characterised throughout the growth cycle of suspension-cultured flax cells. The total PMT activity was maximal during the phase of rapid growth and declined when growth ceased. It was stimulated by exogenous pectins, the optimum type depending on pH. Several basic, neutral and acidic isoforms were solubilised. A number of PME isoforms were present in all three plant systems. In mung bean hypocotyls and poplar stems, neutral isoforms predominated in active cells and basic isoforms in non-growing cells. Three mung bean PMEs were characterised and the most basic one sequenced. It is suggested that as the cells pass beyond the stage of active growth, the pectins are less methyl-esterified at the point when they are exported into the wall and causing stronger bounding of the basic PME isoforms which predominate at that growth stage.},

The products generated by digestion of these pectins with either endopectin lyase (PL) or endopolygalacturonase II (PG II) from Aspergillus niger were analysed using matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation mass spectrometry (MALDIMS) and high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric or UV detection (HPAEC\textendash{}PAD/UV). Time course analysis using MALDIMS was used to identify the most preferred substrate for each enzyme. For PL, this was shown to be fully methyl esterified HG whereas for PG II, long regions of HG without any methyl esterification, as produced by p-PME was the optimal substrate. The blockwise de-esterification caused by p-PME treatment gave a decrease of partly methylated oligomers in PL fingerprints, which did not effect the relative composition of partly methylated oligomers. PG II fingerprints showed a constant increase of monomers and oligomers without any methyl ester groups with decreasing degree of esterification (DE), but almost no change in the concentration of partly methylated compounds. PL fingerprints of f-PME and chemically treated pectins showed decreasing amounts of partly methyl esterified oligomers with decreasing DE, together with a relative shift towards longer oligomers. PG II fingerprints were characterised by an increase of partly methylated and not methylated oligomers with decreasing DE. But differences were also seen between these two forms of homogenous de-esterification. Introduction of a certain pattern of methyl ester distribution caused by selective removal of certain methyl ester groups by f-PME is the most reasonable explanation for the detected differences.},

  abstract = {Pectins are polysaccharides which are able to gel in the presence of calcium ions if their degree of esterification is lower than 40\%.

The pectin-calcium interactions were studied in a dilute solution of calcium pectinates by conductimetry. If the concentration of highly charged polymer is increased, a multichain association can occur: the same process is observed with dilute solutions (cp{$\leq$}10-3 eq. 1-1) but in the presence of an excess of calcium ions. This first step of the gelation was followed by light scattering and by viscometry. The gelling system can be described by a power law including a critical ratio (equivalent concentration of calcium ions/pectin carboxylic sites) and quasi-critical exponents. The values of these critical parameters have been discussed as a function of charge density of the pectins, their esterification pattern, their concentration, and the nature of the divalent counterion.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate the rheological behaviour of mixed gels of high methoxyl (HM) and low methoxyl (LM) pectins with the purpose of designing gels with reduced sucrose content but unaltered rheological properties. The gelation behaviour of mixed HM/LM pectin gels was compared to that of HM and LM pectin gels in the presence of 30\%, 45\% and 60\% sucrose. The gels were investigated in the presence of 0.1\% CaCl2{$\cdot$}2H2O and pH 3.5, conditions that favour the gel formation of both HM and LM pectins. Strong synergistic effects occurred in the rheological behaviour for three mixed 0.8\% HM/0.4\% LM pectin gels under conditions where LM pectin formed microgels instead of coherent gels. The addition of LM pectin strongly increased the storage modulus in mixed HM/LM pectin gels based on 60\% and 45\% sucrose compared to HM pectin gels of the same sucrose concentration. The kinetic behaviour of the mixed HM/LM pectin gels during gel formation varied depending on the kinetic behaviour of the HM pectins differing in degrees of blockiness. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that the gel microstructure of the mixed gel with 60\% sucrose was inhomogeneous. The addition of HM pectin in mixed gels with only 30\% sucrose increased the storage modulus two to five times compared to that of 0.4\% LM pectin gels under the same conditions. The phase angle for the mixed gel with 30\% sucrose was also higher than for the corresponding 0.4\% LM pectin gel.},

The pH was adjusted to 6.0. Heat treatment at 80\textdegree{}C was used to induce WP gelation. Heating WP solution mixed with LMP allowed gel formation with lower protein concentration than normally observed; syneresis was also reduced. The type and proportion of pectin, as well as the calcium concentration affected gel hardness. Increasing the amount of pectin and the calcium concentration made mixed gels firmer. White gels were observed indicating aggregation of WPs. The gelation of the mixed systems appeared to have occurred through a phase separation and a competition between biopolymers for the binding of water and calcium.},

  abstract = {Since collagen is one of the major extracellular matrix components in vascular tissues, its use for vascular tissue engineering has several advantages. However, collagen extraction and processing for tissue engineering application alters its structure. As a result, collagen-based vascular constructs show poor mechanical properties compared to native tissues. In this work, multi-layer (single, double, and triple) vascular tissue constructs were engineered from porcine smooth muscle cells (PSMCs) entrapped in collagen gel by concentrically and sequentially layering after compaction of the previous layer(s). The engineered tissues were matured for either 14 or 21 days to allow the collagen gel to remodel before viscoelasticity, compliance, histological, and protein expression studies were conducted. While there was no significant difference upon addition of the different layers on the elastic modulus (p {$>$} .05), the viscous modulus of the single layer construct was significantly lower than the double and triple layer constructs (p {$<$} .05). Increasing the number of layers of the cellularized collagen construct increased the wall thickness and the viscous modulus of the construct. Furthermore, the cellularized single-layer construct had a relatively high compliance, but the double and triple layer constructs had compliance values comparable to both engineered vessels and native vessels. PSMCs were uniformly distributed throughout the cross-section and expressed the anticipated marker proteins smooth muscle-{$\alpha$} actin, calponin, and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain. Taken together, this study demonstrated the viscoelastic responsiveness of multi-layer collagen-gel based vascular tissues.},

  abstract = {Pectin is an important polysaccharide with applications in foods, Pharmaceuticals, and a number of other industries. Its importance in the food sector lies in its ability to form gel in the presence of Ca2+ ions or a solute at low pH. Although the exact mechanism of gel formation is not clear, significant progress has been made in this direction. Depending on the pectin, coordinate bonding with Ca2+ ions or hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions are involved in gel formation. In low-methoxyl pectin, gelation results from ionic linkage via calcium bridges between two carboxyl groups belonging to two different chains in close contact with each other. In high-methoxyl pectin, the cross-linking of pectin molecules involves a combination of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions between the molecules. A number of factors\textemdash{}pH, presence of other solutes, molecular size, degree of methoxylation, number and arrangement of side chains, and charge density on the molecule\textemdash{}influence the gelation of pectin. In the food industry, pectin is used in jams,jellies, frozen foods, and more recently in low-calorie foods as a fat and/or sugar replacer. In the pharmaceutical industry, it is used to reduce blood cholesterol levels and gastrointestinal disorders. Other applications of pectin include use in edible films, paper substitute, foams and plasticizers, etc. In addition to pectolytic degradation, pectins are susceptible to heat degradation during processing, and the degradation is influenced by the nature of the ions and salts present in the system. Although present in the cell walls of most plants, apple pomace and orange peel are the two major sources of commercial pectin due to the poor gelling behavior of pectin from other sources. This paper briefly describes the structure, chemistry of gelation, interactions, and industrial applications of pectin.},

Recent technological advances have enabled the probing of how primary wall structures and molecular interactions of polysaccharides define their biomechanical (and hence functional) properties. The outputs have led to a new paradigm that places greater emphasis on understanding how the wall, as a biomechanical construct and cell surface sensor, modulates both plant growth and material properties.

We subjected the hydrogels to mechanical pressures to emulate the compressive stresses experienced by cell walls in planta. Our results revealed that the presence of either hemicellulose increased the resistance to compression at fast strain rates. However, at slow strain rates, only xyloglucan increased composite strength. This behaviour could be explained considering the microstructure and the flow of water through the composites confirming their poroelastic nature. In contrast, small deformation oscillatory rheology showed that only xyloglucan decreased the elastic moduli. These results provide evidence for contrasting roles of different hemicelluloses in plant cell wall mechanics and man-made cellulose-based composite materials.},

To investigate this proposed role of pectins, bioinspired wall models were synthesised based on bacterial cellulose containing pectin-calcium gels by varying the order of assembly of cellulose/pectin networks, pectin degree of methylesterification and calcium concentration. Hydrogels in which pectin-calcium assembly occurred prior to cellulose synthesis showed evidence for direct cellulose/pectin interactions from small-angle scattering (SAXS and SANS), had the densest networks and the lowest normal stress. The strength of the pectin-calcium gel affected cellulose structure, crystallinity and material properties. The results highlight the importance of the order of assembly on the properties of cellulose composite networks and support the role of pectin in the mechanics of cell walls.},

A series of mechanical compression steps at different strain rates were performed as a function of cellulose hydrogel thickness, combined with small amplitude oscillatory shear after each step to monitor the viscoelasticity of the sample. During compression, bacterial cellulose hydrogels behaved as anisotropic materials with near zero Poisson's ratio. The micromechanics of the hydrogels altered with each compression as water was squeezed out of the structure, and microstructural changes were strain rate-dependent, with increased densification of the cellulose network and increased cellulose fiber aggregation observed for slower compressive strain rates. A transversely isotropic poroelastic model was used to explain the observed micromechanical behavior, showing that the mechanical properties of cellulose networks in aqueous environments are mainly controlled by the rate of water movement within the structure.},

Solutions were prepared at {$\sim$}95\textdegree{}C and pH was varied by addition of citric acid. With 65wt\% sucrose as cosolute, a critically crosslinked network was formed on cooling to 5\textdegree{}C at pH 4.7. The changes in moduli observed for this composition during cooling were fully reversible on heating, with no thermal hysteresis. Progressive reduction in pH to below the pKa of the galacturonic acid residues caused a sharp, sigmoidal increase in moduli at 5\textdegree{}C, attributed to association of pectin chains into a pectinic acid network. On heating to {$\sim$}15\textdegree{}C, the gel moduli decreased, following the same temperature-course as the changes observed on cooling, but further increase in temperature caused large increases in moduli, consistent with hydrophobic association of methyl ester substituents. These increases became more pronounced as the strength of the gel structure at low temperature was decreased by reduction in sucrose concentration or increase in pH. Heating to 95\textdegree{}C and re-cooling caused a substantial increase in gel strength (G{${'}$} from small-deformation measurements and breaking stress under compression), which is attributed to segregation of chain sequences of high and low ester content during thermal cycling, with the less highly esterified sequences giving stronger pectinic acid junctions at 5\textdegree{}C. Replacement of sucrose by glucose or fructose caused large changes in gelation temperature, in the order: fructose{$<$}sucrose{$<$}glucose. The departure from the normal order of effectiveness (fructose{$<$}glucose{$<$}sucrose) anticipated from compatibility with water structure and observed experimentally for the same sugars in combination with other biopolymers is attributed to inhibition of intermolecular association by strong hydrogen-bonding of primary alcohol groups on the sugars (2 per residue in fructofuranose, 1.5 per residue in sucrose, and 1 per residue in glucopyranose) to the carboxylic acid and methyl ester groups of pectin.},

The rate of gelation close to the gel point can be described as a second-order rate process using the kinetic model of Ross-Murphy (Carbohydr. Polym. 1991, 14, 281) and a critical exponent close to that predicted by the percolation approach. The modulus after a long ageing time showed a power concentration dependence with an exponent around 3.1, higher than the classical square of concentration dependence, which was probably either due to the non-equilibrium state of the HMP gels even after long ageing times, or due to the proximity of the concentration range studied to the critical gelling concentration. The gelation rate of HMP/sucrose systems is strongly dependent on the temperature. An Arrhenius relationship was applied to describe this dependence. Two different processes are proposed to explain the discontinuity observed, each one having rates with different temperature dependence. The applicable kinetics at longer times are quite different, with a lower dependence on polymer concentration and ageing temperature. A non-isothermal kinetic model was used to describe the gelation process of the HMP/sucrose system during cooling.},

The viscoelastic behaviour through the gel point changes with the ageing temperature, probably due to variations in mobility of the pectin chains, and consequently, in the lifetime of junction zones. Weaker pectin networks are formed under thermal conditions unfavourable to the development of hydrophobic interactions.

  abstract = {The interactions between proteins and solvent components have been investigated for the sucrose/water system. Thermodynamic and kinetic measurements of the thermal unfolding of alpha-chymotrypsin, chymotrypsinogen, and ribonuclease were performed as a function of sucrose concentration. The alteration in protein-solvent interactions in the presence of sucrose was also studied by density measurements and analyzed by multicomponent thermodynamic theory. Sucrose does not induce a conformational change in three proteins studied, although it does induce a small change in the circular dichroism spectrum of ribonuclease. The enthalpy of thermal unfolding shows little dependence on the concentration of sucrose, while the apparent activation energy of the unfolding process is increased by the addition of sucrose. The results from the protein-solvent interaction study indicate that sucrose is preferentially excluded from the protein domain, increasing the free energy of the system. Thermodynamically this leads to protein stabilization since the unfolded state of the protein becomes thermodynamically even less favorable in the presence of sucrose. The exclusion of sucrose from the protein domain seems to be related to the higher cohesive force of the sucrose water solvent system since all the experimental observations can be correlated with the effect of sucrose on the surface tension of water.},

  abstract = {This review article (Part II) is a sequel to an earlier one (Part I) that dealt with means of removal and interpretation of stress singularities in elasticity, as well as their asymptotic and numerical analysis. It reviews contributions to the literature that have actually effected asymptotic identifications of possible stress singularities for specific configurations. For the most part, attention is focused on 2D elastostatic configurations with constituent materials being homogeneous and isotropic. For such configurations, the following types of stress singularity are identified: power singularities with both real and complex exponents, logarithmic intensification of power singularities with real exponents, pure logarithmic singularities, and log-squared singularities. These identifications are reviewed for the in-plane loading of angular elastic plates comprised of a single material in Section 2, and for such plates comprised of multiple materials in Section 3. In Section 4, singularity identifications are examined for the out-of-plane shear of elastic wedges comprised of single and multiple materials, and for the out-of-plane bending of elastic plates within the context of classical and higher-order theory. A review of stress singularities identified for other geometries is given in Section 5, axisymmetric and 3D configurations being considered. A limited examination of the stress singularities identified for other field equations is given as well in Section 5. The paper closes with an overview of the status of singularity identification within elasticity. This Part II of the review has 227 references.},

Open multi-methods generalize multiple dispatch towards open-class extensions, which improve separation of concerns and provisions for retroactive design. We present the rationale, design, implementation, and performance of a language feature, called open multimethods, for C++. Our open multi-methods support both repeated and virtual inheritance. Our call resolution rules generalize both virtual function dispatch and overload resolution semantics. After using all information from argument types, these rules can resolve further ambiguities by using covariant return types. Great care was taken to integrate open multi-methods with existing C++ language features and rules. We describe a model implementation and compare its performance and space requirements to existing open multi-method extensions and workaround techniques for C++. Compared to these techniques, our approach is simpler to use, catches more user mistakes, and resolves more ambiguities through link-time analysis, runs significantly faster, and requires less memory. In particular, the runtime cost of calling an open multimethod is constant and less than the cost of a double dispatch (two virtual function calls). Finally, we provide a sketch of a design for open multi-methods in the presence of dynamic loading and linking of libraries.},

  abstract = {Materials respond to external load by deforming and straining, and by developing stresses. The internal stresses corresponding to a given set of strains depend on the constitution of the material itself. For this reason, the rules that permit calculation of internal stresses from known strains, or vice versa, are called constitutive laws or constitutive equations. There are two equivalent ways to describe the mathematical relationships between stresses and strains for viscoelastic materials. One form uses integrals to define the constitutive relations, while the other relates stresses and strains by means of differential equations. Starting from Boltzmann's superposition principle, this chapter develops the integral form of the one-dimensional constitutive equations for linearly viscoelastic materials. This is followed by a discussion of the principle of fading memory, which helps to define the acceptable analytical forms of the material property functions. It is then shown that the closed-cycle condition (i.e., that the steady-state response of a non-aging viscoelastic material to a periodic excitation be periodic) requires that the material property functions depend only on the difference of their arguments. The chapter also examines the relationships between the relaxation modulus and creep compliance functions in the physical time domain as well as in Laplace-transformed space. Various alternative forms of the integral constitutive equations often encountered in practice are discussed as well.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel computational approach, the discrete singular convolution (DSC) algorithm, for analysing plate structures. The basic philosophy behind the DSC algorithm for the approximation of functions and their derivatives is studied. Approximations to the delta distribution are constructed as either bandlimited reproducing kernels or approximate reproducing kernels. Uni{\"y}ed features of the DSC algorithm for solving di erential equations are explored. It is demonstrated that di erent methods of implementation for the present algorithm, such as global, local, Galerkin, collocation, and {\"y}nite di erence, can be deduced from a single starting point. The use of the algorithm for the vibration analysis of plates with internal supports is discussed. Detailed formulation is given to the treatment of di erent plate boundary conditions, including simply supported, elastically supported and clamped edges. This work paves the way for applying the DSC approach in the following paper to plates with complex support conditions, which have not been fully addressed in the literature yet.

  abstract = {Recent technological changes have transformed an increasing number of sectors of the economy into so-called superstars sectors, in which a small number of entrepreneurs or professionals distribute their output widely to the rest of the economy. Examples include the high-tech sector, sports, the music industry, management,  nance, etc. As a result, these superstars reap enormous rewards, whereas the rest of the workforce lags behind. We describe superstars as arising from digital innovations, whicih replace a fraction of the tasks in production with information technology that requires a  xed cost but can be reproduced at zero marginal cost. This generates a form of increasing returns to scale. To the extent that the digital innovations are excludable, it also provides the innovator with market power. Our paper studies the implications of superstar technologies for factor shares, for inequality and for the e ciency properties of the superstar economy.},

  abstract = {Pectate (polygalacturonic acid) acts as a chelator to bind calcium and form cross-links that hold adjacent pectate polymers and thus plant cell walls together. When under tension from turgor pressure in the cell, the cross-links appear to distort and weaken. New pectate supplied by the cytoplasm is undistorted and removes wall calcium preferentially from the weakened bonds, loosening the wall and accelerating cell expansion. The new pectate now containing the removed calcium can bind to the wall, strengthening it and linking expansion to wall deposition. But new calcium needs to be added as well to replenish the calcium lost from the vacated wall pectate. A recent report demonstrated that growth was disrupted if new calcium was unavailable. The present addendum highlights this conclusion by reviewing an experiment from before the chelation chemistry was understood. Using cell wall labeling, a direct link appeared between wall expansion and wall deposition. Together, these experiments support the concept that newly supplied pectate has growth activity on its way to deposition in the wall. Growth rate is thus controlled by signals affecting the rate of pectate release. After release, the coordination of expansion and deposition arises naturally from chelation chemistry when polymers are under tension from turgor pressure.},

  abstract = {Summary.Plant cell walls are essential for proper growth, development, and interaction with the environment. It is generally accepted that land plants arose from aquatic ancestors which are sister groups to the charophycean algae (i.e., Streptophyta), and study of wall evolution during this transition promises insight into structure\textendash{}function relationships of wall components. In this paper, we explore wall evolutionary history by studying the incorporation of pectin polymers into cell walls of the model organism Penium margaritaceum, a simple single-cell desmid. This organism produces only a primary wall consisting of three fibrillar or fibrous layers, with the outermost stratum terminating in distinct, calcified projections. Extraction of isolated cell walls with trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N{${'}$},N{${'}$}-tetraacetic acid yielded a homogalacturonan (HGA) that was partially methyl esterified and equivalent to that found in land plants. Other pectins common to land plants were not detected, although selected components of some of these polymers were present. Labeling with specific monoclonal antibodies raised against higher-plant HGA epitopes (e.g., JIM5, JIM7, LM7, 2F4, and PAM1) demonstrated that the wall complex and outer layer projections were composed of the HGA which was significantly calcium complexed. JIM5 and JIM7 labeling suggested that highly methyl esterified HGA was secreted into the isthmus zone of dividing cells, the site of active wall secretion. As the HGA was displaced to more polar regions, de-esterification in a non-blockwise fashion occurred. This, in turn, allowed for calcium binding and the formation of the rigid outer wall layer. The patterning of HGA deposition provides interesting insights into the complex process of pectin involvement in the development of the plant cell wall.},

This has resulted in compositional variation that is dependent on developmental stage, cell type, and season. Further variation is evident that has a phylogenetic basis. Plants and algae have a complex phylogenetic history, including acquisition of genes responsible for carbohydrate synthesis and modification through a series of primary (leading to red algae, green algae, and land plants) and secondary (generating brown algae, diatoms, and dinoflagellates) endosymbiotic events. Therefore, organisms that have the shared features of photosynthesis and possession of a cell wall do not form a monophyletic group. Yet they contain some common wall components that can be explained increasingly by genetic and biochemical evidence.},

A minimal quantity of heat, proportional to the thermal energy and called the Landauer bound, is necessarily produced when a classical bit of information is deleted. A direct consequence of this logically irreversible transformation is that the entropy of the environment increases by a finite amount. Despite its fundamental importance for information theory and computer science2,3,4,5, the erasure principle has not been verified experimentally so far, the main obstacle being the difficulty of doing single-particle experiments in the low-dissipation regime. Here we experimentally show the existence of the Landauer bound in a generic model of a one-bit memory. Using a system of a single colloidal particle trapped in a modulated double-well potential, we establish that the mean dissipated heat saturates at the Landauer bound in the limit of long erasure cycles. This result demonstrates the intimate link between information theory and thermodynamics. It further highlights the ultimate physical limit of irreversible computation.},

Objective: To quantify the state of reproducibility of empirical AI research using six reproducibility metrics measuring three different degrees of reproducibility. Hypotheses: 1) AI research is not documented well enough to reproduce the reported results. 2) Documentation practices have improved over time. Method: The literature is reviewed and a set of variables that should be documented to enable reproducibility are grouped into three factors: Experiment, Data and Method. The metrics describe how well the factors have been documented for a paper. A total of 400 research papers from the conference series IJCAI and AAAI have been surveyed using the metrics. Findings: None of the papers document all of the variables. The metrics show that between 20\% and 30\% of the variables for each factor are documented. One of the metrics show statistically significant increase over time while the others show no change. Interpretation: The reproducibility scores decrease with increased documentation requirements. Improvement over time is found. Conclusion: Both hypotheses are supported.},

  volume = {25},
  issn = {09609822},
  abstract = {Complex shapes in biology depend on the ability of cells to shift from isotropic to anisotropic growth during development. In plants, this growth symmetry breaking reflects changes in the extensibility of the cell walls. The textbook view is that the direction of turgor-driven cell expansion depends on the cortical microtubule (CMT)-mediated orientation of cellulose microfibrils [1, 2]. Here, we show that this view is incomplete at best. We used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to study changes in cell-wall mechanics associated with growth symmetry breaking within the hypocotyl epidermis. We show that, first, growth symmetry breaking is preceded by an asymmetric loosening of longitudinal, as compared to transverse, anticlinal walls, in the absence of a change in CMT orientation. Second, this wall loosening is triggered by the selective de-methylesterification of cell-wall pectin in longitudinal walls, and, third, the resultant mechanical asymmetry is required for the growth symmetry breaking. Indeed, preventing or promoting pectin de-methylesterification, respectively, increased or decreased the stiffness of all the cell walls, but in both cases reduced the growth anisotropy. Finally, we show that the subsequent CMT reorientation contributes to the consolidation of the growth axis but is not required for the growth symmetry breaking. We conclude that growth symmetry breaking is controlled at a cellular scale by bipolar pectin de-methylesterification, rather than by the cellulose-dependent mechanical anisotropy of the cell walls themselves. Such a cell asymmetry-driven mechanism is comparable to that underlying tip growth in plants [3] but also anisotropic cell growth in animal cells [4].},

  abstract = {A central problem in plant biology is how cell expansion is coordinated with wall synthesis. We have studied growth and wall deposition in epidermal cells of dark-grown Arabidopsis hypocotyls. Cells elongated in a biphasic pattern, slowly first and rapidly thereafter. The growth acceleration was initiated at the hypocotyl base and propagated acropetally. Using transmission and scanning electron microscopy, we analyzed walls in slowly and rapidly growing cells in 4-d-old dark-grown seedlings. We observed thick walls in slowly growing cells and thin walls in rapidly growing cells, which indicates that the rate of cell wall synthesis was not coupled to the cell elongation rate. The thick walls showed a polylamellated architecture, whereas polysaccharides in thin walls were axially oriented. Interestingly, innermost cellulose microfibrils were transversely oriented in both slowly and rapidly growing cells. This suggested that transversely deposited microfibrils reoriented in deeper layers of the expanding wall. No growth acceleration, only slow growth, was observed in the cellulose synthase mutant cesA6prc1-1 or in seedlings, which had been treated with the cellulose synthesis inhibitor isoxaben. In these seedlings, innermost microfibrils were transversely oriented and not randomized as has been reported for other cellulose-deficient mutants or following treatment with dichlorobenzonitrile. Interestingly, isoxaben treatment after the initiation of the growth acceleration in the hypocotyl did not affect subsequent cell elongation. Together, these results show that rapid cell elongation, which involves extensive remodeling of the cell wall polymer network, depends on normal cellulose deposition during the slow growth phase.},

  volume = {12},
  issn = {1478-3975},
  abstract = {The mechanical response of a living cell is notoriously complicated. The complex, heterogeneous characteristics of cellular structure introduce difficulties that simple linear models of viscoelasticity cannot overcome, particularly at deep indentation depths. Herein, a nano-scale stress-relaxation analysis performed with an atomic force microscope reveals that isolated human breast cells do not exhibit simple exponential relaxation capable of being modeled by the standard linear solid (SLS) model. Therefore, this work proposes the application of the fractional Zener (FZ) model of viscoelasticity to extract mechanical parameters from the entire relaxation response, improving upon existing physical techniques to probe isolated cells. The FZ model introduces a new parameter that describes the fractional time-derivative dependence of the response. The results show an exceptional increase in conformance to the experimental data compared to that predicted by the SLS model, and the order of the fractional derivative ({$\alpha$}) is remarkably homogeneous across the populations, with a median value of 0.48 {$\pm$} 0.06 for the malignant population and 0.51 {$\pm$} 0.07 for the benign. The cells' responses exhibit power-law behavior and complexity not associated with simple relaxation (SLS, {$\alpha$} = 1) that supports the application of a fractional model. The distributions of some of the FZ parameters also preserve the distinction between the malignant and benign sample populations seen from the linear model and previous results while including the contribution of fast-relaxation behavior. The resulting viscosity, measured by a composite relaxation time, exhibits considerably less dispersion due to residual error than the distribution generated by the linear model and therefore serves as a more powerful marker for cell differentiation.},

The use of fractional-order models is motivated by recent experimental studies indicating that such models provide a new flexible alternative to fitting biological tissue data. This is attributed to their inherent ability to control the interplay between elastic energy storage and viscous dissipation by tuning a single parameter, the fractional order a, as well as to account for a continuous viscoelastic relaxation spectrum. We perform simulations using four viscoelastic parameter data-sets aiming to compare different viscoelastic models and highlight the important role played by the fractional order. Moreover, we carry out a detailed global stochastic sensitivity analysis study to quantify uncertainties of the input parameters that define each wall model. Our results confirm that the effect of fractional models on hemodynamics is primarily controlled by the fractional order, which affects pressure wave propagation by introducing viscoelastic dissipation in the system.},

  abstract = {We develop efficient numerical methods for fractional order PDEs, and employ them to investigate viscoelastic constitutive laws for arterial wall mechanics. Recent simulations using onedimensional models [1] have indicated that fractional order models may offer a more powerful alternative for modeling the arterial wall response, exhibiting reduced sensitivity to parametric uncertainties compared with the integer-calculus-based models. Here, we study three-dimensional (3D) fractional PDEs that naturally model the continuous relaxation properties of soft tissue, and for the first time employ them to simulate flow structure interactions for patient-specific brain aneurysms. To deal with the high memory requirements and in order to accelerate the numerical evaluation of hereditary integrals, we employ a fast convolution method [2] that reduces the memory cost to O(log(N)) and the computational complexity to O(N log(N)). Furthermore, we combine the fast convolution with high-order backward differentiation to achieve third-order time integration accuracy. We confirm that in 3D viscoelastic simulations, the integer order models strongly depends on the relaxation parameters, while the fractional order models are less sensitive. As an application to long-time simulations in complex geometries, we also apply the method to modeling fluid\textendash{}structure interaction of a 3D patient-specific compliant cerebral artery with an aneurysm. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that fractional calculus can be employed effectively in modeling complex behavior of materials in realistic 3D time-dependent problems if properly designed efficient algorithms are employed to overcome the extra memory requirements and computational complexity associated with the non-local character of fractional derivatives.},

  abstract = {To approximate convolutions which occur in evolution equations with memory terms, a variable-step-size algorithm is presented for which advancing N steps requires only O(N log N ) operations and O(log N ) active memory, in place of O(N 2) operations and O(N ) memory for a direct implementation. A basic feature of the fast algorithm is the reduction, via contour integral representations, to differential equations which are solved numerically with adaptive step sizes. Rather than the kernel itself, its Laplace transform is used in the algorithm. The algorithm is illustrated on three examples: a blowup example originating from a Schr\textasciidieresis{}odinger equation with concentrated nonlinearity, chemical reactions with inhibited diffusion, and viscoelasticity with a fractional order constitutive law.},

  title = {Anisotropic Growth Is Achieved through the Additive Mechanical Effect of Material Anisotropy and Elastic Asymmetry},
  abstract = {Fast directional growth is a necessity for the young seedling: after germination, the seedling needs to quickly reach through the soil to begin its autotrophic life. In most dicot plants, this rapid escape is due to the anisotropic elongation of the hypocotyl, the columnar organ between the root and the shoot meristems. Anisotropic growth is common in plant organs and is canonically attributed to cell wall anisotropy produced by oriented cellulose fibers. Recently, a mechanism based on asymmetric pectin-based cell wall elasticity has been proposed. Here we present a harmonizing model for anisotropic growth control in the dark-grown Arabidopsis hypocotyl: basic anisotropic information is provided by cellulose orientation) and additive anisotropic information is provided by pectin-based elastic asymmetry in the epidermis. We quantitatively show that hypocotyl elongation is anisotropic from germination. We present experimental evidence for pectin biochemical differences and wall mechanics providing important growth regulation in the hypocotyl. Lastly, our in silico modelling experiments indicate an additive combination for pectin biochemistry and cellulose orientation in promoting anisotropic growth.},

A geometric algebra is a multidimensional generalization of complex numbers and of quaternions, and able to accurately describe oriented spatial objects and relations between them. We further propose a kernel to measure similarity between two series of spatial vectors based on Hidden Markov Models. As an apllication, we demonstrate our new method with the semi-supervised learning of online hand-written digits. The result shows that the feature extraction with geometric algebra improved recognition rate in one-to-one semi-supervised learning problems of online hand-written digits.},

It should be sufficient to collect one of these functions by a measurement to obtain the two other functions. However, this process seems to be rarely used. One reason for this may be the very large frequency intervals over which the Fourier transform should be computed. It is not unusual to find a ratio of 1030 between the lowest and the highest frequencies. We propose a semi-analytical algorithm for computing the creep and the relaxation functions from complex modulus data. Exact in nature, it makes use of very basic assumptions. Good correlation with approximate alternative methods is found. In this paper, we illustrate our method using some examples of creep compliance and relaxation modulus synthesis from the master curves.},

Conversely, it is generally accepted that any logically reversible transformation of information can in principle be accomplished by an appropriate physical mechanism operating in a thermodynamically reversible fashion. These notions have sometimes been criticized either as being false, or as being trivial and obvious, and therefore unhelpful for purposes such as explaining why Maxwell's Demon cannot violate the second law of thermodynamics. Here I attempt to refute some of the arguments against Landauer's principle, while arguing that although in a sense it is indeed a straightforward consequence or restatement of the Second Law, it still has considerable pedagogic and explanatory power, especially in the context of other influential ideas in nineteenth and twentieth century physics. Similar arguments have been given by Jeffrey Bub (2002).},

  abstract = {Seeing mechanical properties of living cells
Mechanical properties of cells and the matrix that surrounds them contribute to cell shape, control cell migration, and regulate cell growth. Elsayad et al. engineered a microscope system that integrated fluorescence emission detection with detection of a light-scattering process called the Brillouin frequency shift and called the method fluorescence emission\textendash{}Brillouin scattering imaging (FBi). With this optical approach, the authors showed that the mechanical properties of live plants can be visualized at the submicrometer scale and demonstrated that this approach can be used to investigate regulatory events that alter cellular and extracellular mechanical properties of living cells within tissues. This work also revealed that the cytoplasm near the cell membrane and the extracellular matrix are regions of locally increased stiffness and showed that the sides parallel to the growth axis of an expanding plant hypocotyl, but not root, cells are ``stiffer'' than the sides perpendicular to the growth axis. Thus, FBi is another tool in the microscopy toolkit for exploring properties of cells and tissues.
Extracellular matrices (ECMs) are central to the advent of multicellular life, and their mechanical properties are modulated by and impinge on intracellular signaling pathways that regulate vital cellular functions. High spatial-resolution mapping of mechanical properties in live cells is, however, extremely challenging. Thus, our understanding of how signaling pathways process physiological signals to generate appropriate mechanical responses is limited. We introduce fluorescence emission\textendash{}Brillouin scattering imaging (FBi), a method for the parallel and all-optical measurements of mechanical properties and fluorescence at the submicrometer scale in living organisms. Using FBi, we showed that changes in cellular hydrostatic pressure and cytoplasm viscoelasticity modulate the mechanical signatures of plant ECMs. We further established that the measured ``stiffness'' of plant ECMs is symmetrically patterned in hypocotyl cells undergoing directional growth. Finally, application of this method to Arabidopsis thaliana with photoreceptor mutants revealed that red and far-red light signals are essential modulators of ECM viscoelasticity. By mapping the viscoelastic signatures of a complex ECM, we provide proof of principle for the organism-wide applicability of FBi for measuring the mechanical outputs of intracellular signaling pathways. As such, our work has implications for investigations of mechanosignaling pathways and developmental biology.
Fluorescence-Brillouin imaging reveals that plants regulate the mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix in response to light.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) are functional bowel disorders. Evidence suggests that disturbance in the gastrointestinal microbiota may be implicated in both conditions. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the efficacy of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics in IBS and CIC.
METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched (up to December 2013). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting adults with IBS or CIC, which compared prebiotics, probiotics, or synbiotics with placebo or no therapy, were eligible. Dichotomous symptom data were pooled to obtain a relative risk (RR) of remaining symptomatic after therapy, with a 95\% confidence interval (CI). Continuous data were pooled using a standardized or weighted mean difference with a 95\% CI.
RESULTS: The search strategy identified 3,216 citations. Forty-three RCTs were eligible for inclusion. The RR of IBS symptoms persisting with probiotics vs. placebo was 0.79 (95\% CI 0.70\textendash{}0.89). Probiotics had beneficial effects on global IBS, abdominal pain, bloating, and flatulence scores. Data for prebiotics and synbiotics in IBS were sparse. Probiotics appeared to have beneficial effects in CIC (mean increase in number of stools per week = 1.49; 95\% CI = 1.02\textendash{}1.96), but there were only two RCTs. Synbiotics also appeared beneficial (RR of failure to respond to therapy = 0.78; 95\% CI 0.67\textendash{}0.92). Again, trials for prebiotics were few in number, and no definite conclusions could be drawn.
CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics are effective treatments for IBS, although which individual species and strains are the most beneficial remains unclear. Further evidence is required before the role of prebiotics or synbiotics in IBS is known. The efficacy of all three therapies in CIC is also uncertain.},

Our study also suggests a design principle for nonmuscular hydraulically actuated structures: Rapid actuation requires either small size or the enhancement of motion on large scales via elastic instabilities.
Movement in plants leads to insights into how hydraulically driven systems operate.

Most of the pectin (60\textendash{}80\%) did not interact at the molecular level with cellulose, as judged by small angle scattering techniques (SAXS and SANS). Despite the lack of strong interactions with cellulose, this pectin fraction impacted the mechanical properties of the hydrogels through poroelastic effects. The other 20\textendash{}40\% of pectin (containing neutral sugar sidechains) was able to interact intimately with cellulose microfibrils at the point of assembly. These results support the need to revise the role of pectin in cell wall architecture and mechanics, and; furthermore they assist the design of cellulose-based products through controlling the viscoelasticity of the fluid phase.},

Their higher-order fractional constitutive equations are derived due to the models' constructions. We call them the higher-order fractional constitutive equations because they contain three different fractional parameters and the maximum order of equations is more than one. The relaxation and creep functions of the higher-order fractional constitutive equations are obtained by Laplace transform method. As particular cases, the analytical solutions of standard (integer-order) quadratic constitutive equations are contained. The generalized Mittag\textendash{}Leffler function and H-Fox function play an important role in the solutions of the higher-order fractional constitutive equations. Finally, experimental data of human cranial bone are used to fit with the models given by this paper. The fitting plots show that the models given in the paper are efficient in describing the property of viscoelastic materials.},

  abstract = {A new pectin was extracted from the leaves of Krueo Ma Noy (Cissampelos pareira), a woody climbing plant grown in Thailand. Optimized condition for the extraction of pectin was using the solid:solvent ratioZ1:50 in distilled water at 25\textendash{}28 8C and natural pH (3.8\textendash{}4.0). A crude pectin extract was obtained after alcohol precipitation and drying; the crude extract was dialyzed and lyophilization produced a dialyzed pectin fraction. The extracted Krueo Ma Noy pectin is a low methoxyl pectin which consisted mainly of uronic (galacturonic) acid (w70\textendash{}75\%) and small amounts of neutral sugars. Krueo Ma Noy pectin exhibited shear thinning flow behavior and the extent of shear thinning was concentration dependent. Gelation was observed when Krueo Ma Noy pectin (both crude extract and dialyzed fractions) concentration exceeded 0.5\% (w/v); gel strength of the dialyzed fraction was much higher than that of the crude extract. The addition of NaCl significantly increased the Krueo Ma Noy pectin gel strength when salt concentration was below 0.4 M. Krueo Ma Noy pectin was also found to be sensitive to Ca2C ions: the addition of 1 mM calcium chloride significantly increased the gel strength and excessive amount of Ca2C (O3 mM) resulted in aggregation/precipitation of the pectin, possibly due to the calcium binding properties of the carboxyl group. It was also observed that addition of sugar increased the gel strength of Krueo Ma Noy pectin.},

  abstract = {Mixtures of high-methoxy pectin (DE 70; 1.0 wt\%; pH 3.0) with ethan-1,2-diol, glycerol, xylitol, sorbitol, glucose, fructose or sucrose at concentrations of 50, 55, 60 and 65 wt\% were prepared at 95 8C and changes in storage modulus {\dh}G0{\TH} and loss modulus {\dh}G00{\TH} during cooling to 5 8C, heating to 90 8C and re-cooling to 5 8C (at 1 8C/min) were measured at 1 rad s21 and 0.5\% strain. In all cases, the onset temperature for gelation during cooling and the moduli recorded at 5 8C increased with increasing concentration of cosolute. Both values, however, were substantially lower for the liquid cosolutes (ethan-1,2-diol and glycerol) than for mixtures incorporating the same concentrations of the solid cosolutes. The difference is attributed to inhibition of pectin\textendash{} pectin interactions by pectin \textendash{} cosolute interactions, which in turn are inhibited by cosolute\textendash{} cosolute interactions, these being weaker for the liquid cosolutes than for the solids (as indicated by lower melting points). On heating, there was an initial reduction in modulus, with the same temperature-course as the increase on cooling; for the solid cosolutes, this was followed by an increase attributable to hydrophobic association of methyl ester substituents. No such increase was seen with the liquid cosolutes, but differential scanning calorimetry studies showed two (reversible) thermal transitions in all cases, one over the temperaturerange of the initial gelation process on cooling and the other coincident with the increase in modulus on heating in the presence of the solid cosolutes. The absence of any detectable increase in modulus on heating with the liquid cosolutes is attributed to accumulation of cosolute around the polymer chains (i.e. pectin \textendash{} cosolute interactions) promoting hydrophobic association between methyl ester groups on the same chain, or within small clusters of chains, with, therefore, no contribution to network structure. At high concentrations of the solid cosolutes, the increase in modulus on heating was followed by a decrease at higher temperature; this is attributed to excessive aggregation, and was reflected in lower moduli on subsequent re-cooling to 5 8C, in contrast to the enhancement in gel strength after heating and cooling that was observed at lower concentrations of the same cosolutes.},

  abstract = {Gels of high-methoxy pectin (DE 70; 1.0 wt\%; pH 3.0) in the presence of fructose at concentrations of 50, 55, 60 and 65 wt\% showed an intense endotherm followed immediately by an intense exotherm on heating. These transitions occurred over approximately the same temperature-range as initial gelation on cooling (characterised by low-amplitude oscillatory measurements of G0 and G00) and increased in magnitude with increasing concentration of fructose. The displacement of both transitions, and particularly the exotherm, to progressively higher temperature as the rate of heating was increased was much greater than anticipated from simple thermal lag, indicating that the underlying structural changes are slow. The proposed interpretation is that fructose is capable of site-binding to pectin in both the ordered (threefold helix) and disordered state; the endotherm is attributed to helix melting and displacement of fructose; the subsequent exotherm is attributed to re-attachment of fructose to disordered chains, and the slow kinetics of this process to the conformational mobility of disordered pectin. On cooling over the same temperature range, a single exotherm was observed; the absence of detectable splitting is attributed to rapid re-attachment of fructose to conformationally-rigid helices. The magnitude of this endotherm (DH {$<$} 20 J/g) is close to the value found for cosolutes that show no evidence of site-binding, and to the net change in enthalpy for the endothermic and exothermic processes observed on heating, suggesting that the values of DH for displacement and re-attachment of fructose are essentially equal and opposite, with the net change coming from formation or melting of threefold helices. A smaller thermal process at higher temperature (endothermic on heating and exothermic on cooling) is attributed to hydrophobic association, which was also seen as an increase in G0 and G00 on heating in two consecutive cycles of temperature change.},

  abstract = {Cohesive gels have been obtained by de-esterification of 1.0 wt \% high-methoxy citrus pectin (degree of esterification \% 68\%) in the presence of Ca2+ cations, using a commercial preparation (NovoShape) of fungal methyl esterase cloned from Aspergillus aculeatus. A convenient rate of network formation (gelation within \$30 min) was achieved at an enzyme concentration of 0.2 PEU/g pectin. At a Ca2+-concentration of 40 mM and incubation temperature of 20 \textdegree{}C, severe syneresis ({$>$}7\% of sample mass) was observed, but release of fluid decreased with decreasing concentration of Ca2+ and increasing temperature of incubation, becoming undetectable for 10 mM Ca2+ at 30 \textdegree{}C. Under these conditions, progressive development of solid-like character (storage modulus, G0) was observed during 160 min of enzymic de-esterification, and the mechanical spectrum recorded at the end of the incubation period had the form typical of a biopolymer gel. On subsequent heating to 70 \textdegree{}C, dissociation of the gel network (sigmoidal reduction in G0 and G00) was observed. At or above the midpoint temperature of this melting process (\$50 \textdegree{}C), there was no indication of gel formation on enzymic de-esterification (at 50 or 60 \textdegree{}C). At lower temperatures (20, 30 and 40 \textdegree{}C), the rate of gelation (assessed visually) showed no systematic increase as the incubation temperature was increased towards the temperature-optimum of the enzyme (\$50 \textdegree{}C). This unexpected behaviour is attributed to competition between faster de-esterification and slower formation of Ca2+induced `egg-box' junctions.},

The link has been found in the physical origins of the power-laws, ruling the evolution of many natural phenomena, whose long memory and hereditary properties are mathematically modelled by differential operators of non integer order. Dealing with the relevant example of a viscous fluid seeping through a fractal shaped porous medium, we show that, once a physical phenomenon or process takes place on an underlying fractal geometry, then a power-law naturally comes up in ruling its evolution, whose order is related to the anomalous dimension of such geometry, as well as to the model used to describe the physics involved. By linearizing the non linear dependence of the response of the system at hand to a proper forcing action then, exploiting the Boltzmann superposition principle, a fractional differential equation is found, describing the dynamics of the system itself. The order of such equation is again related to the anomalous dimension of the underlying geometry.},

This contrasts with the mass element which, by definition, always has one terminal connected to ground. The inerter allows electrical circuits to be translated over to mechanical ones in a completely analogous way. The inerter need not have large mass. This allows any arbitrary positive-real impedance to be synthesized mechanically using physical components which may be assumed to have small mass compared to other structures to which they may be attached. The possible application of the inerter is considered to a vibration absorption problem, a suspension strut design, and as a simulated.},

  abstract = {We use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the linear viscoelastic response of a model three-dimensional particulate gel. The numerical simulations are combined with a novel test protocol (the optimally windowed chirp or OWCh), in which a continuous exponentially varying frequency sweep windowed by a tapered cosine function is applied. The mechanical response of the gel is then analyzed in the Fourier domain. We show that (i) OWCh leads to an accurate computation of the full frequency spectrum at a rate significantly faster than with the traditional discrete frequency sweeps, and with a reasonably high signal-to-noise ratio, and (ii) the bulk viscoelastic response of the microscopic model can be described in terms of a simple mesoscopic constitutive model. The simulated gel response is in fact well described by a mechanical model corresponding to a fractional Kelvin-Voigt model with a single Scott-Blair (or springpot) element and a spring in parallel. By varying the viscous damping and the particle mass used in the microscopic simulations over a wide range of values, we demonstrate the existence of a single master curve for the frequency dependence of the viscoelastic response of the gel that is fully predicted by the constitutive model. By developing a fast and robust protocol for evaluating the linear viscoelastic spectrum of these soft solids, we open the path toward novel multiscale insight into the rheological response for such complex materials.},

MRE was performed using cylindrical 'phantoms' of the same material in an overlapping frequency range of 100\textendash{}400 Hz. Axial vibrations of a central rod caused radially propagating shear waves in the phantom. Displacement fields were fit to a viscoelastic form of Navier's equation using a total least-squares approach to obtain local estimates of G *. DST estimates of the storage G ' (Re[ G *]) and loss modulus G '' (Im[ G *]) for the tissue-mimicking material increased with frequency from 0.86 to 0.97 kPa (20\textendash{}200 Hz, n = 16), while MRE estimates of G ' increased from 1.06 to 1.15 kPa (100\textendash{}400 Hz, n = 6). The loss factor (Im[ G *]/Re[ G *]) also increased with frequency for both test methods: 0.06\textendash{}0.14 (20\textendash{}200 Hz, DST) and 0.11\textendash{}0.23 (100\textendash{}400 Hz, MRE). Close agreement between MRE and DST results at overlapping frequencies indicates that G * can be locally estimated with MRE over a wide frequency range. Low signal-to-noise ratio, long shear wavelengths and boundary effects were found to increase residual fitting error, reinforcing the use of an error metric to assess confidence in local parameter estimates obtained by MRE.},

  abstract = {A study of viscoelastic shear wave dispersion in a simulated gelation process involving mechanically self-similar nodal networks is reported. The network formed at the gel point (the infinite network cluster, or `critical gel') shares a common structural feature of smaller network clusters and the onset of a recognizably `gel-like' feature is shown to occur when the characteristic wavelength of the network cluster becomes twice that of an individual node. It is shown that, during gelation, the dispersion of shear waves can be exploited to assess the proximity of a system to an equivalent `critical gel' state at any single frequency, thereby identifying the smallest length scale at which gel-like characteristics are established prior to the gel point. In this way, and for the first time, a rheometrical basis is established for examining the gel-like, self-similar characteristics of pre-gel point viscoelastic liquid systems, in terms of the gel equation but in the absence of a frequency-independent loss tangent. Experiments are reported for a critical gel in which the high-frequency wave dispersion is in good agreement with theory.},

PMMA has been studied by dynamic mechanical spectrometry and the experimental data have been compared with the fractional calculus model proposed. An agreement between experiments and model has been achieved. PMMA is characterised by an unstable non-equilibrium state, at least between the main secondary relaxation ({$\beta$}) and the main relaxation ({$\alpha$}). All molecular mobility phenomena are affected by this structural recovery that itself exists because of molecular mobility.

  issn = {0957-0233, 1361-6501},
  abstract = {Interpretation of experimental data from micro- and nano-scale indentation testing is highly dependent on the constitutive model selected to relate measurements to mechanical properties. The Kelvin\textendash{}Voigt fractional derivative model (KVFD) offers a compact set of viscoelastic features appropriate for characterizing soft biological materials. This paper provides a set of KVFD solutions for converting indentation testing data acquired for different geometries and scales into viscoelastic properties of soft materials. These solutions, which are mostly in closed-form, apply to ramp-hold relaxation, load-unload and ramp-load creep-testing protocols. We report on applications of these model solutions to macro- and nano-indentation testing of hydrogels, gastric cancer cells and ex vivo breast tissue samples using an atomic force microscope (AFM). We also applied KVFD models to clinical ultrasonic breast data using a compression plate as required for elasticity imaging. Together the results show that KVFD models fit a broad range of experimental data with a correlation coefficient typically R2\,\,{$>$}\,\,0.99. For hydrogel samples, estimation of KVFD model parameters from test data using spherical indentation versus plate compression as well as ramp relaxation versus load-unload compression all agree within one standard deviation. Results from measurements made using macro- and nano-scale indentation agree in trend. For gastric cell and ex vivo breast tissue measurements, KVFD moduli are, respectively, 1/3\textendash{}1/2 and 1/6 of the elasticity modulus found from the Sneddon model. In vivo breast tissue measurements yield model parameters consistent with literature results. The consistency of results found for a broad range of experimental parameters suggest the KVFD model is a reliable tool for exploring intrinsic features of the cell/tissue microenvironments.},

  abstract = {Viscoelastic properties of soft biological tissues provide information that may be useful in medical diagnosis. Noninvasive elasticity imaging techniques, such as Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE), reconstruct viscoelastic material properties from dynamic displacement images. The reconstruction algorithms employed in these techniques assume a certain viscoelastic material model and the results are sensitive to the model chosen. Developing a better model for the viscoelasticity of soft tissue-like materials could improve the diagnostic capability of MRE. The well known ``integer derivative'' viscoelastic models of Voigt and Kelvin, and variations of them, cannot represent the more complicated rate dependency of material behavior of biological tissues over a broad spectral range. Recently the ``fractional derivative'' models have been investigated by a number of researchers. Fractional order models approximate the viscoelastic material behavior of materials through the corresponding fractional differential equations. This paper focuses on the tissue mimicking materials CF-11 and gelatin, and compares fractional and integer order models to describe their behavior under harmonic mechanical loading. Specifically, Rayleigh (surface) waves on CF-11 and gelatin phantoms are studied, experimentally and theoretically, in order to develop an independent test bed for assessing viscoelastic material models that will ultimately be used in MRE reconstruction algorithms.},

Use of fractional calculus to this end is frequently restricted to descriptions of dynamic behaviour, for example in dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA), where the dependence of the complex modulus on frequency can be expressed algebraically in closed form. However, this approach is only valid in the steady state. The material's approach to the steady state, and the effect of the slowly-decaying transient on DMTA measurements, are addressed here. ``Data'' are generated by integration of the time-domain fractional integral constitutive equation describing the fractional Zener model, and are analysed by a procedure inspired by a commercial DMTA instrument manual. Results show that the frequency dependence of the decay of the initial transient leads to difficulties in retrieving a single parameter set from the data, demonstrating that a specific procedure is required when evaluating long-memory materials.},

Schapery's elastic-viscoelastic correspondence principle is applied as a means of separately evaluating viscoelasticity and time-dependent damage growth in asphalt concrete. The time-dependent damage growth in asphalt concrete is modeled by using a damage parameter based on a generalization of rnicrocrack growth law. Internal state variable formulation was used in developing the analytical representation of the model. Tensile uniaxial fatigue tests were performed under the controlled-strain mode to determine model parameters. Then, the resulting constitutive equation was used to predict the stress-strain behavior of the same materials under controlled-stress mode. The constitutive equation proposed in this paper satisfactorily predicts the constitutive behavior of asphalt concrete all the way up to failure under various loading conditions including different stress-strain amplitudes, monotonic versus cyclic loadings, and different modes of loading.},

  volume = {10},

  abstract = {Modelling the viscoelastic behavior of rubber for use in component design remains a challenge. Most of the literature does not consider the typical regimes encountered by anti-vibration devices that are deformed to medium dynamic strains (0.5 to 3.5) at medium strain rates (0.5/s to 10/s). Previous studies have either focused on the behaviour at small strains and small strain rates or in fast loading conditions that result in low cycle fatigue or tearing phenomena. There is a lack of understanding of the dynamic response of natural rubber suspension components when used in real vehicle applications. This paper presents a review of popular viscoelastic nonlinear constitutive models and their ability to model the mechanical behaviour of typical elastomer materials such as Natural Rubber (NR) incorporating different PHR (Parts per Hundred Rubber, XX) of carbon black. The range of strain and strain rate are typical for the materials used in rubber suspensions when operating in severe service operating conditions, such as over rough terrain or over pot-holes. The cyclic strain is applied at different amplitudes and different strain rates in this medium strain range. Despite the availability of many models in the literature, our study reports that none of the existing models can fit the data satisfactorily over a wide range of conditions.},

  abstract = {To simulate the evolution of wellbore creep accurately, predict and prevent severe accidents such as borehole wall sloughing, casing collapse and sticking of the drill, based on previous studies, the springpot element was introduced into the classical element model and the creep compliances of the fractional constitutive models were deduced. The good fitting effect of fractional constitutive model was verified. The study shows the fractional constitutive model can simulate creep with high accuracy and less input parameters, and the physical significance of the input parameters are clearer. According to the correspondence principle of viscoelastic theory, a wellbore creep model including drilling and killing processes was built up. By adjusting the value of fractional orders, the model can transform between the models of ideal elastic material and standard solid, which implies the classical wellbore shrinkage model based on standard solid model and ideal elastic model are just special cases of this model. If the fractional order is adjusted, the creep curve will change asymmetrically, which can be can be regulated by the speeding up of the transient creep and lowering the rate of steady creep, which can not be accomplished by adjusting one parameter in the classical models. The fractional constitutive model can fit complicated non-linear creep experiment data better than other models.},

  abstract = {Based on the fractal derivative, a robust viscoelastic element\textemdash{}fractal dashpot\textemdash{}is proposed to characterize the rheological behaviors of non-Newtonian fluid. The mechanical responses of the fractal dashpot are investigated with different strains and stresses, which are compared with the existing dashpot models, including the Newton dashpot and the Abel dashpot. The results show that as the derivative order is between 0 and 1, the viscoelastic behavior of the fractal dashpot is similar to that of the Abel dashpot. However, the fractal dashpot has a high computational efficiency compared with the Abel dashpot. On the other hand, the fractal dashpot can be reduced to the Newton dashpot when the derivative order equals to 1. As an extension of fractal dashpot, a fractal Bingham model is also introduced in this study. The accuracy of proposed fractal models is verified by the relevant rheological experimental data. Moreover, the obtained parameters can not only provide quantitative insights into both the viscoelasticity and the relative strength of rheopexy and thixotropy, but also quantitatively distinguish shear thinning and thickening phenomena.},

This study used the soft interlayer of the Permian Maokou Formation in Southwest China as an example to perform ring shear creep tests with different water content amounts. The effect of water content on the creep properties of the soft interlayer was analyzed, and a new shear rheological model was established. This research produced several findings. First, the ring shear creep deformation of the soft interlayer samples varied with the water content and the maximum instantaneous shear strain increment occurred near the saturated water content. As the water content increased, the cumulative creep increment of the samples increased. Second, the water content significantly affected the long-term strength of the soft interlayer, which decreased with the increase of water content, exhibiting a negative linear correlation. Third, a constitutive equation for the new rheological model was derived, and through fitting of the ring shear creep test data, the validity and applicability of the constitutive equation were proven. This study has developed an important foundation for studying the long-term deformation characteristics of a soft interlayer with varying water content.},

  abstract = {Tight gas is one important unconventional hydrocarbon resource that is stored in tight sandstone, whose mechanical property greatly influences the tight gas production process and is commonly believed to be simply elastic when designing the stimulation plan. However, the experimental evidence provided in this work surprisingly shows that tight sandstone can deform in a viscoelastic way. Such an unexpected observation poses a challenge in accurately modelling the deformation process. We solve this problem by adopting the fractional Maxwell model to successfully derive the constitutive equation of tight sandstone, based on which not only all the experimental data can be interpreted quantitatively, but also reasonable and consistent predictions as to tight sandstone's long-term deformation behaviour can be made. We then investigate the typicality of our results in China's Changqing oilfield, which is one major centre of tight gas production and where the rock samples for experiments are obtained. It is estimated that a non-negligible portion of 18\% tight sandstone samples in this area will probably display viscoelasticity. Finally, our work implies that the mechanical properties of other materials may also need further scrutiny to possibly uncover any unexpected behaviour, overlooking which may result in misleading predictions.},

The model parameters which include the dynamic viscosities of the springpots and the fractional exponent are calibrated using existing experimental data of basic creep strain in concrete under constant stress and temperatures for various aggregate types. The power law form of the naturally resulting creep compliance allows an accurate representation of experimental data with the use of only a few model parameters. Furthermore, the variable-order fractional differential stress-strain equation provides a compact method for analytical and numerical modelling of basic creep under conditions of time-varying stress and temperature. In addition, applications of the proposed model to determine axial deformations in columns and transverse deflections in beams under constant and varying temperatures are demonstrated.},

Cell wall swelling was examined in intact fruit using microscopy techniques and in vitro, using cell wall material isolated from fruit tissue.

In-vivo swelling was marked only in avocado and blackberry. Fruit which ripened to a crisp, fracturable texture [apple (two cultivars), nashi pear, watermelon] did not show either in-vivo or in-vitro swelling of the cell wall. There was a correlation between swelling and the degree of pectin solubilisation, suggesting that wall swelling occurred as a result of changes to the viscoelastic properties of the cell wall during pectin solubilisation. Chemical and enzymatic removal of pectin from kiwifruit cell wall material supported the idea that swelling is associated with movement of water into voids left in the cellulose-hemicellulose network by the solubilised pectin. However, the results also suggested that swelling in vivo was more complex than this, and that the physicochemical changes which led to swelling included other elements of cell wall modi\textregistered{}cation involving the site and mechanism of pectin solubilisation andor the cellulose-xyloglucan complex.},

At higher rennet concentrations and after longer times, the reaction passes to first order (constant kt). After very long times it doubtless becomes more complex.},

  abstract = {The rheology of process cheese during heating and cooling was examined by measuring the transient and dynamic linear viscoelastic properties of regular fat, lower moisture and an 80\% reduced-fat, higher moisture pasteurized process cheese from 10 to 50\textdegree{}C. The dynamic (stress and frequency sweep) and transient (creep and recovery) rheological properties of the reduced-fat process cheese were found to be higher than that of regular-fat process cheese, indicating that fat content changed rheological properties more than moisture content. The temperature-dependent frequency dispersions of storage and loss moduli (dynamic mechanical spectra) were fitted with a power-law model, and master curves (at a reference temperature of 30\textdegree{}C) and shift factors were obtained by shifting the temperaturedependent frequency dispersion of dynamic mechanical spectra. The relaxation spectra (moduli, viscosities and relaxation times) of both cheeses were obtained from the master curves using the generalized Maxwell model and nonlinear regression. The viscosity distribution of corresponding Maxwell model elements were higher for the reduced-fat cheese by a factor of 1.6\textendash{}4.7 compared to the regular-fat cheese, indicating that the higher moisture content in the reduced-fat process cheese did not loosen the protein matrix or soften the cheese even though higher moisture is recommended to cheese manufacturers in order to compensate for some textural defects in reduced-fat cheeses.},

Psycho-physical experunents have shown the advantages of the latter approach in studying those industrially important rheological concepts, such as `firmness', which cannot be expressed in dunensionally simple terms.},

  volume = {69},
  issn = {0167-6636},
  abstract = {Creep and/or Relaxation tests on viscoelastic materials show a power-law trend. Based upon Boltzmann superposition principle the constitutive law with a power-law kernel is ruled by the Caputo's fractional derivative. Fractional constitutive law posses a long memory and then the parameters obtained by best fitting procedures on experimental data are strongly influenced by the prestress on the specimen. As in fact during the relaxation test the imposed history of deformation is not instantaneously applied, since a unit step function may not be realized by the test machine. Usually an initial ramp is present in the deformation history and the time at which the deformation attains the maximum value is fixed by the operator. Even though the pre-charge time is small in comparison with the total duration of the observation time, the parameters obtained by the best fitting procedure leads to relevant error especially for small observation time. In the paper the problem is overcome by considering the time load history for both theoretical and experimental point of view. In order to demonstrate experimentally that the initial ramp of deformation strongly influences the stress history during the relaxation test, different tests were performed on samples of a commercial epoxy resin (SP106) at two different rates of deformation (i.e. 0.2mm/mm and 2mm/min). Moreover the corrected approach for the best fitting of the data permits to characterize the viscoelastic materials, in term of fractional viscoelastic parameters, in a short time, and this allows to reduce the long duration of the experimental tests.},

  abstract = {We report on the interplay between creep and residual stresses in a carbopol microgel.

For applied shear stresses lower than some typical value {$\sigma$}c 0.2{$\sigma$}y, the microgel experiences a more complex, anomalous creep behavior, characterized by an initial decrease of the strain, that we attribute to the existence of residual stresses of the order of {$\sigma$}c that persist after a rest time under a zero shear rate following preshear. The influence of gel concentration on creep and residual stresses are investigated as well as possible aging effects. We discuss our results in light of previous works on colloidal glasses and other soft glassy systems.},

  abstract = {In the present article alginate hydrogels and novel hydrogels based on blends of alginate/N-succinylchitosan have been realized in water solution at neutral conditions. The gels have been obtained by crosslinking via the internal setting method using calcium carbonate (CaCO3) as calcium ions source. A rheological investigation of both the plain alginate and the alginate/N-succinylchitosan blend hydrogels has been performed by means of oscillatory dynamic measurements. The effect of the inclusion of different amounts of CaCO3 on the critical deformation ({$\gamma$}c) characterizing the limit of the linear viscoelastic regime has been studied for the plain alginate gels. The frequency response in small amplitude oscillatory experiments of the plain alginate gels has been investigated in terms of the storage (G{${'}$}) and loss (G{${''}$}) modulus behavior. The dynamic data have been interpreted in terms of the Friedrich and Heymann model. The inclusion of the N-succinylchitosan, in the range 10\textendash{}50\% w/w, had no effect on the {$\gamma$}c values. On the contrary, when the 10\% w/w of the N-succinylchitosan is added to the plain alginate gels, a significant increase in the storage modulus values is recorded for all the systems analyzed. The gelation kinetics has been investigated and the results indicate that the kinetics process can be accelerated increasing the percentage of Ca+2 ions and/or including the N-succinylchitosan in the plain alginate systems. Finally, the morphological analysis of scaffolds obtained from the hydrogels through freeze-drying revealed an interconnected porous structure. \textcopyright{} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  volume = {29},
  issn = {0024-9297},
  abstract = {We measure the complex rheological behavior of nearly critical gels and analyze the data by searching for characteristic patterns and abstracting those patterns into a self-consistent model. The sample is a linear, flexible, nearly monodisperse polybutadiene which gets cross-linked on its vinyl side groups. The dynamic mechanical storage and loss moduli of cross-linking polymers change smoothly during the liquid-solid transition, while equilibrium rheological properties (e.g., zero-shear viscosity and equilibrium compliance) diverge. During gelation, the relaxation occurs in a distinct pattern which can be described in a quantitative way with a minimum number of parameters. The pattern can be understood as a combination of the BSW spectrum (representing the precursor relaxation behavior) and the self-similar Chambon-Winter gel spectrum (modeling the terminal relaxation due to growing clusters). The spectrum is cut off at the material's longest relaxation time, {$\lambda$}max. Our model parameters, {$\lambda$}max and Ge (equilibrium modulus), exhibit characteristic scaling behavior with respect to the distance from the gel point, |p - pc|. The relaxation exponent, n, in the terminal zone is a function of the extent of reaction. Hence, dynamic scaling (requires constant n values) is not valid for our system. The proposed model passes the self-consistency test by predicting the mechanical behavior (at different frequencies) as a function of the extent of reaction and other rheological observations during the sol-gel transition.},

  abstract = {Many complex fluids exhibit power-law responses in their relaxation modulus; examples include foods, soft solids, fractal gels, and other polydisperse systems. In the present study we investigate the rheological characteristics of such materials beyond the linear regime using a gluten-water gel as a prototypical system. The material functions of gluten dough under finite strains can be described by combining the linear viscoelastic response of a critical gel [Chambon, and Winter, J. Rheol. 31, 683\textendash{}697 (1987)] with a Lodge rubberlike network to develop a frame invariant constitutive equation [Winter and Mours, Adv. Polym. Sci. 134, 165\textendash{}233 (1997)]. This generalized gel equation is a simple but accurate description of the material functions in the linear regime and also at large strains, using only two parameters. We compare the model predictions with experimental measurements in transient shear and elongational flows of gluten gels over a wide range of deformation rates. An essential feature of both the experimental data and the generalized gel model is a strain{$\slash$}rate separability in the system response. Further modifications to the generalized gel equation can be made by incorporating a damping function to include nonlinear strain softening effects seen in more complex gels such as wheat-flour doughs. From the rheological data, we find compelling evidence that indicates gluten to be a polymeric network consisting of flexible or semiflexible chains between junction points with a typical mesh size of approximately 20nm20nm{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll" altimg="eq-00001.gif"{$><$}mrow{$><$}mn{$>$}20{$<$}/mn{$><$}mspace width="0.3em"{$><$}/mspace{$><$}mi{$>$}nm{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}.},

The gelation time of the system decreased with increasing PVA and cross-linker concentrations. At the gel point, a power law frequency dependence of the dynamic storage modulus (G{${'}$} {$\propto$} {$\omega$}n{${'}$}) and loss modulus (G{${'}{'}$} {$\propto$} {$\omega$}n{${'}{'}$}) was observed with n{${'}$} ) n{${'}{'}$} ) n. The power law exponent is lower than that predicted (0.7) from the percolation model. The value of n decreases with increasing polymer and cross-linker concentrations. The critical gel strength parameter (S) rises with increasing polymer and cross-linker concentrations. Some stress relaxation measurements on gelling PVA systems were also carried out. At the gel point, a power law time dependence of the relaxation modulus was detected, but the relaxation exponent was lower than the corresponding one obtained from oscillatory shear measurements. The fractal dimension (df) was determined for the incipient PVA gels. The value of df increased with increasing polymer concentration and cross-linking density. This trend of df suggests a more ``tight'' structure of the network at higher polymer concentrations and cross-linking densities.},

The model closely represents the master curves of dynamic moduli over 15 logarithmic decades of frequency with three parameters for the flow regime (GN0 N {$\eta$}0 and a cut-off parameter {$\lambda$}max) and four parameters for the FMF.

A study of the rheological behavior of wheat bread dough containing BNC was performed by thermo-rheological and isothermal dynamic oscillatory experiments. The baking response and bread quality parameters were also analyzed. BNC increased specific volume, and moisture retention, decreasing browning index. Although BNC produced both raw and heat-treated doughs with more elastic characteristics, textural studies revealed that the addition of BNC reduced firmness of bread crumb. Confocal laser scanning microscopy observations showed differences in gluten filaments between control and BNC crumb samples that could explain the larger average porous size of BNC crumb. BNC could be used as improver in the bread-making performance.},

In the latter, the readjustment of the material clock, which accounts for the time dependency, facilitates validation of the ef fective time translational invariance. By carrying out experiments on cross-linking PDMS, we show that material that is undergoing time evolution in the real time domain indeed validates the Boltzmann superposition principle and convolution relation relating creep compliance and relaxation modulus in the effective time domain.},

  abstract = {The aim of the present work was to determine the factors limiting growth in mechanically impeded roots. Pea roots were grown in compressed and uncompressed sand cores, and then removed and transferred to hydroponics. Root elongation was slowed in impeded sand cores and did not recover to the unimpeded rates until 60 h after transfer to the hydroponics system. Root diameter was greater in impeded roots, and only after 36 h in hydroponics was new root tissue produced of the same diameter as the unimpeded controls. The turgor pressure of the growing cells was measured with a turgor probe and was the same in both treatments. The slower elongation rate of the previously impeded roots was, therefore, the result of axial tightening of the cell walls. Cell length profiles suggested that axial cell wall tightening persisted in the unrestricted hydroponics system. Production of new cells in unrestricted conditions was required before root elongation returned to the unimpeded state. Osmotic potential was decreased by approximately 0.2 MPa in previously impeded roots compared with the unimpeded ones. This corresponds to a decrease in water potential of 0.2 MPa. These data are discussed in relation to regulation of cell extension, solute unloading and the penetration of compacted soils by roots.},

The scaling relation between all exponents is in excellent agreement with the Rouse model and is consistent with the percolation theory. Transient rheological properties exhibit complex scaling behavior above the gel point depending on {$\epsilon$}. Scaling above the gel point correlates with the polymer structure.},

All the films, with and without polyglycerol as plasticizer, were crosslinked with zinc ions in order to extend their potential functionality. The development of junction points, occurring during the crosslinking process with zinc ions, induced the increasing of free volume with following changing in chemico-physical properties of films. The inclusion of alginate in pectin based formulations improved the strength of zinc ions crosslinking network, whereas the addition of polyglycerol significantly improved mechanical performance. Finally, zinc-crosslinked films evidenced antimicrobial activity against the most common exploited pathogens: Staphylococcus Aureus, Escherichia Coli and Candida Albicans. These results suggest that zinc-crosslinked based films can be exploitable as novel bio-active biomaterials for protection and disinfection of medical devices.},

This microstructure endows the wall with nonlinear anisotropic mechanical properties and allows enzymatic regulation of expansive cell growth. We present a mathematical model of hemicellulose crosslink dynamics in an expanding cell wall incorporating strain-enhanced breakage and enzyme-mediated crosslink kinetics. The model predicts the characteristic yielding behaviour in the relationship between stress and strain-rate seen experimentally, and suggests how the effective yield and extensibility of the wall depend on microstructural parameters and on the action of enzymes of the XTH and expansin families. The model suggests that the yielding behaviour encapsulated in the classical Lockhart equation can be explained by the strongly nonlinear dependence of crosslink breakage rate on crosslink elongation. The model also demonstrates how enzymes that target crosslink binding can be effective in softening the wall in its pre-yield state, whereas its post-yield extensibility is determined primarily by the pectin matrix.},

Assuming elastic equilibrium and a linear viscoelastic wall, cell elongation rate is derived as a function of osmotic pressure, ``extensibility'' of the wall, water permeability and cell size. The derived formulations predict growth curves comparable to those observed experimentally. Certain consequences of the derived formulations are discussed. It is shown that the turgor pressure of a growing cell will always be less than the water potential of the cell. This difference may be infinitesimal or finite, depending on the values of the physical parameters of the cell. It is also shown that at positive turgor pressures water must always move from a mature cell to a growing cell.},

Second, in response to renewed recognition of the severe flaws of null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), we need to shift from reliance on NHST to estimation and other preferred techniques. The new statistics refers to recommended practices, including estimation based on effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis. The techniques are not new, but adopting them widely would be new for many researchers, as well as highly beneficial. This article explains why the new statistics are important and offers guidance for their use. It describes an eight-step new-statistics strategy for research with integrity, which starts with formulation of research questions in estimation terms, has no place for NHST, and is aimed at building a cumulative quantitative discipline.},

The recent surge of big data research has made the p-value an even more popular tool to test the significance of a study. However, substantial literature has been produced critiquing how p-values are used and understood. In this paper we review this recent critical literature, much of which is routed in the life sciences, and consider its implications for social scientific research. We provide a coherent picture of what the main criticisms are, and draw together and disambiguate common themes. In particular, we explain how the False Discovery Rate is calculated, and how this differs from a p-value. We also make explicit the Bayesian nature of many recent criticisms, a dimension that is often underplayed or ignored. We conclude by identifying practical steps to help remediate some of the concerns identified. We recommend that (i) far lower significance levels are used, such as 0.01 or 0.001, and (ii) p-values are interpreted contextually, and situated within both the findings of the individual study and the broader field of inquiry (through, for example, meta-analyses).},

  abstract = {Summary There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

  abstract = {The polysaccharide-rich cell walls (CWs) of plants perform essential functions such as maintaining tensile strength and allowing plant growth. Using two- and three-dimensional magic-angle-spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR and uniformly 13C-labeled Arabidopsis thaliana, we have assigned the resonances of the major polysaccharides in the intact and insoluble primary CW and determined the intermolecular contacts and dynamics of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and pectins. Cellulose microfibrils showed extensive interactions with pectins, while the main hemicellulose, xyloglucan, exhibited few cellulose cross-peaks, suggesting limited entrapment in the microfibrils rather than extensive surface coating. Site-resolved 13C T1 and 1H T1F relaxation times indicate that the entrapped xyloglucan has motional properties that are intermediate between the rigid cellulose and the dynamic pectins. Xyloglucan absence in a triple knockout mutant caused the polysaccharides to undergo much faster motions than in the wild-type CW. These results suggest that load bearing in plant CWs is accomplished by a single network of all three types of polysaccharides instead of a cellulose-xyloglucan network, thus revising the existing paradigm of CW structure. The extensive pectin-cellulose interaction suggests a central role for pectins in maintaining the structure and function of plant CWs. This study demonstrates the power of multidimensional MAS NMR for molecular level investigation of the structure and dynamics of complex and energy-rich plant materials.},

  abstract = {During the initial phases of elongation of pea internodes, oat and rice coleoptiles, oat mesocotyls, soybean hypocotyls and dandelion peduncles, net transverse orientation of cellulose wall microfibrils (Mfs) was found in the outer epidermal wall. This paper demonstrates that in all these axes, with the exception of rice coleoptile, net longitudinal orientation of microfibrils occurs in the outer epidermal wall in portions of the axes that were still elongating at the time of sampling. The timing of the transition to net longitudinal orientation and whether the transition proceeded acropetally or basipetally varied with the type of axis under study. The variability of the relationship between extension and the transition from net transverse to net longitudinal orientation suggests that factors other than extension are important in determining the transition. Layers of longitudinal wall microfibrils may be added to the extending epidermal wall to bolster its tensile strength commensurate with its function during and after extension. Attention is drawn to the parallels between the concept of tissue tension in growing axes and the concept that the epidermis functions as a stressed skin in the support of mature plant parts in primary growth.},

Leaf epidermis contains jigsaw puzzle piece-shaped pavement cells whose shape has been proposed to be a result of subcellular variations in expansion rate that induce local buckling events. Paradoxically, such local compressive buckling should not occur given the tensile stresses across the epidermis. Using computational modeling, we show that the simplest scenario to explain pavement cell shapes within an epidermis under tension must involve mechanical wall heterogeneities across and along the anticlinal pavement cell walls between adjacent cells. Combining genetics, atomic force microscopy, and immunolabeling, we demonstrate that contiguous cell walls indeed exhibit hybrid mechanochemical properties. Such biochemical wall heterogeneities precede wall bending. Altogether, this provides a possible mechanism for the generation of complex plant cell shapes.},

  abstract = {Epidermal cells of leaves are diverse: tabular pavement cells, trichomes, and stomatal complexes. Pavement cells from the monocot Zea mays (maize) and the eudicot Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) have highly undulate anticlinal walls. The molecular basis for generating these undulating margins has been extensively investigated in these species. This has led to two assumptions: first, that particular plant lineages are characterized by particular pavement cell shapes; and second, that undulatory cell shapes are common enough to be model shapes. To test these assumptions, we quantified pavement cell shape in epidermides from the leaves of 278 vascular plant taxa. We found that monocot pavement cells tended to have weakly undulating margins, fern cells had strongly undulating margins, and eudicot cells showed no particular undulation degree. Cells with highly undulating margins, like those of Arabidopsis and maize, were in the minority. We also found a trend towards more undulating cell margins on abaxial leaf surfaces; and that highly elongated leaves in ferns, monocots and gymnosperms tended to have highly elongated cells. Our results reveal the diversity of pavement cell shapes, and lays the quantitative groundwork for testing hypotheses about pavement cell form and function within a phylogenetic context.},

  abstract = {The rheological behaviour of biopolymer gels is commonly investigated by means of small amplitude oscillatory measurements. This consolidated approach was used in the present paper to characterize the influence of ionic strength and temperature on the gelation of commercial low-methoxyl pectin (LMP) (DE \textonequarter{} 22.5\%). The main results showed that the sol/gel transition is very sensitive to the ionic strength of the medium, while the viscoelastic properties of the gel structure, developed over 8 h cure test, were retained up to 60  C. The soft material under study displays the typical rheological behaviour of a solidlike material, in good agreement with results previously reported in the literature. It is known that the best time or frequency window useful to explore in dynamic mode the viscolelastic behaviour of complex materials such as a gel would range over several decades of frequency. The possibility to extend the frequency domain of the dynamic tests in the region of the lower frequencies (10{\`A}5\textendash{}102 rad s{\`A}1) was therefore investigated by matching information coming from dynamic and transient rheological tests and converting data from time domain into frequency domain throughout the discrete retardation spectrum of the material, as described by Kaschta [Kaschta, J., \& Schwarzl, F.

  abstract = {Rheological behavior of five different pectin-enriched products obtained from a cell wall enriched powder of butternut (Cucurbita moschata Duch ex Poiret) was evaluated through flow and oscillatory assays. The product SE was obtained through treatment with citrate buffer; C1 and C2 were obtained using cellulase and different enzyme\textendash{}substrate ratios while H1 and H2 resulted from hemicellulase treatment at different levels. SE- and H1-pectin-enriched fractions showed the best performance as thickeners as indicated by their highest Newtonian viscosities and time constants on shear-thinning along the flow. These fractions showed a structure with the highest density of interactions between the hydrated macromolecules when solutions were evaluated at rest. Fractions obtained with a higher activity of hemicellulase (H2) or with the lowest activity of cellulase assayed (C1) showed the same degree of structure when evaluated at rest, while C2-fraction presented the lowest density of macromolecular interactions in water, behaving as a diluted hydrocolloid solution as confirmed by its fitting to the Cox\textendash{}Merz rule. Molecular weight distribution of polysaccharide fractions along with chemical composition helped to explain the rheological behavior of these isolated fractions which contained between 39 and 78 g of galacturonic acid per 100 g of product. With the exception of C2 fraction, pectinenriched products isolated from butternut showed an interesting range of thickening properties and can be used as thickeners in the food industry.},

As these biopolymeric networks have stress-bearing filaments whose force-extension relations are independently accessible in single-molecule experiments, they thus provide a rather unique test of our current understanding of the relationship between the mechanical properties of a gel and those of its constituent chains. Here we show that remarkable agreement is found between the predictions of a numerical simulation, based solely on the concentration, connectivity, and individual mechanical responses of the biopolymers, with the experimentally measured bulk network properties.},

However, not as yet extensively studied is the impact on gelation of the distribution of the charges as characterized by an absolute degree of blockiness (DBabs). The aim of this study was to characterize rheologically the acid gelation of a pectin with a high DBabs and a degree of methyl esterification of {$\sim$}37\%, in the absence and presence of monovalent ions. The results obtained suggest that a pectin with a blocky charge distribution at pH conditions close to or below the pKa exhibits weak gel-like properties at intermediate frequencies, despite the absence of a permanent network structure. The addition of monovalent ions changed the rheological behavior to resemble that of a strong gel whose properties depended on the type and concentration of the ions.},

  abstract = {Forced-oscillation measurements of aqueous dispersions of an amide pectin were carried out at pH 3.83 in the presence of 50\% sucrose. The results show a predominant viscous behaviour corresponding to the so-called terminal region of the general mechanical spectrum of biopolymer solutions. The polymer chains have been described by the bead-spring model with dominant hydrodynamic interactions among beads. At pH 3.31, samples are more elastic than viscous and the mechanical spectra reveal an entanglement network (weak gel), although not dense enough to store the stress during a long period of time after having been deformed. At low pectin concentration, the plot of loss moduli versus frequency shows a minimum that suggest monodisperse junction zones and the existence of two regions with different relaxation times. The short relaxation process corresponds to movements of galacturonic units inside the junction zones (local configuration adjustment), and the longer one to movements of the junction zone as a whole (rearrangements of couplings through entanglement and cross-linking). The comparison of the results obtained here at different sucrose concentrations and temperatures with those for methoxy pectins, suggests that the hydrogen bonds formed by amide groups have an important role in the formation of the gel. The role of the hydrophobic interactions in the stability of the junction zones has also been discussed.},

  abstract = {We have examined the mechanical behaviour of different types of pectin at high concentrations ({$>$}30\% w/w), relevant to the behaviour of pectin in the plant cell wall, and as a film-forming agent. Mechanical properties were examined as a function of counterion type (K+, Ca2+, Mg2+), concentration and extent of hydration. Hydration was controlled in an osmotic stress experiment where pectin films were exposed to concentrated polyethylene glycol [PEG] solutions of known osmotic pressure. We investigated the mechanical behaviour under simple extension. The results show that the swelling and stiffness of the films are strongly dependent on pectin source and ionic environment. At a fixed osmotic stress, both Ca2+ or Mg2+ counterions reduce swelling and increase the stiffness of the film.},

The texture of each gel was evaluated using three descriptors: firmness, coarseness, and graininess. The relaxation behavior of the 14 gels, under a constant strain, was monitored using an Instron universal testing machine. The data were best defined by an equation that is represented b y t w o Maxwell bodies in parallel. The elastic moduli and relaxation times o f this model ranged, between gels, f r o m 2881 Pa to 5487 Pa and from 4.1 s to 908 s, respectively. A n apparatus constructed in this laboratory was used t o measure the creep behavior of the gels under constant stress. The normal creep behavior o f the 14 gels was best defined by the Burger's Model. The elastic moduli and viscous constants of this model ranged, between gels, from 3937 Pa to 15,342 Pa and from 20,300 P1 to 40,100 P1,respectively. The relaxation modulus, E , , was the most sensitive f o r distinguishing significant differences between the gels.

  abstract = {Homogeneous water-soluble non-feruloylated arabinoxylan fractions from wheat flour (cv. Soissons) have been studied for their fine structure. Arabinosyl residue distribution on arabinoxylan chains was investigated through periodate oxidation and enzymic hydrolysis methods. A double oxidation and reduction sequence was used to effect complete oxidation of arabinoxylans and an hydrolysis time of 180 min was used for Smith degradation with HCl 0.02 M at 100 8C. Periodate oxidation, reduction and mild acid hydrolysis produced xylosides containing up to six residues. Analysis by HPAEC of the xylosides liberated by mild acid hydrolysis revealed that an increase in arabinose to xylose ratio is expressed on the polymer by an increase in length of substituted regions and greater proportions of them. Enzymic hydrolysis with a xylanase from Aspergillus aculeatus of lowly and highly substituted fractions revealed great differences in degradation extent. Random distribution of arabinose residues along the xylan backbone was computed and compared to experimental results.},

  abstract = {Primary cell walls from exponentially growing cell-suspension cultures of spinach contained ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid esterified with galactopyranose and arabinopyranose residues of polysaccharides. The feruloylated polysaccharides behaved in exactly the same way as total cell-wall pectin with respect to (1) extraction with chelating agents, (2) extraction by trans-elimination degradation, (3) extraction with mild acid, and (4) electrophoretic separation into acidic and neutral species. Partial digestion of cell walls with Driselase, under conditions which specifically inhibited galactanase and galactosidases, yielded galactose-containing feruloyl tri- to pentasaccharides, in all of which the feruloyl group was on the non-reducing terminus. Larger feruloyl oligosaccharides were also found, some of which were acidic. Partial acid-hydrolysis of cell walls gave a homologous series of feruloyl oligosaccharides, probably with the structure Feruloyl-arabinopyranose-(arabinofuranose)n-arabinose where n = 0-7. Evidence is presented that the arabinose chain was unbranched, with the feruloyl group on the nonreducing terminus. It is suggested that acidic and neutral pectins carry ferulic acid on the non-reducing termini of the neutral arabinose- and/or galactose-containing domains. The pectins carry approximately one feruloyl residue per 60 sugar residues. Possible r61es of feruloyl pectin in the regulation of cell expansion, in disease resistance, and in the initiation of lignification are discussed.},

  abstract = {One major component of plant cell walls is a diverse group of polysaccharides, the hemicelluloses. Hemicelluloses constitute roughly one-third of the wall biomass and encompass the heteromannans, xyloglucan, heteroxylans, and mixed-linkage glucan. The fine structure of these polysaccharides, particularly their substitution, varies depending on the plant species and tissue type. The hemicelluloses are used in numerous industrial applications such as food additives as well as in medicinal applications. Their abundance in lignocellulosic feedstocks should not be overlooked, if the utilization of this renewable resource for fuels and other commodity chemicals becomes a reality. Fortunately, our understanding of the biosynthesis of the various hemicelluloses in the plant has increased enormously in recent years mainly through genetic approaches. Taking advantage of this knowledge has led to plant mutants with altered hemicellulosic structures demonstrating the importance of the hemicelluloses in plant growth and development. However, while we are on a solid trajectory in identifying all necessary genes/proteins involved in hemicellulose biosynthesis, future research is required to combine these single components and assemble them to gain a holistic mechanistic understanding of the biosynthesis of this important class of plant cell wall polysaccharides.},

Focusing on multicellular organs, I survey the occurrence of expansion anisotropy and discuss its causes and proposed controls. Expansion anisotropy of a unit area of cell wall is characterized by the direction and degree of anisotropy. The direction of maximal expansion rate is usually regulated by the direction of net alignment among cellulose microfibrils, which overcomes the prevailing stress anisotropy. In some stems, the directionality of expansion of epidermal cells is controlled by that of the inner tissue. The degree of anisotropy can vary widely as a function of position and of treatment. The degree of anisotropy is probably controlled by factors in addition to the direction of microfibril alignment. I hypothesize that rates of expansion in maximal and minimal directions are regulated by distinct molecular mechanisms that regulate interactions between matrix and microfibrils.},

  volume = {64},
  issn = {1460-2431, 0022-0957},
  abstract = {We review the role of anisotropic stress in controlling the growth anisotropy of stems. Instead of stress, growth anisotropy is usually considered in terms of compliance. Anisotropic compliance is typical of cell walls, because they contain aligned cellulose microfibrils, and it appears to be sufficient to explain the growth anisotropy of an isolated cell. Nevertheless, a role for anisotropic stress in the growth of stems is indicated by certain growth responses that appear too rapid to be accounted for by changes in cell-wall compliance and because the outer epidermal wall of most growing stems has microfibrils aligned axially, an arrangement that would favour radial expansion based on cell-wall compliance alone. Efforts to quantify stress anisotropy in the stem have found that it is predominantly axial, and large enough in principle to explain the elongation of the epidermis, despite its axial microfibrils. That the epidermis experiences a stress deriving from the inner tissue, the so-called `tissue stress', has been widely recognized; however, the origin of the dominant axial direction remains obscure. Based on geometry, an isolated cylindrical cell should have an intramural stress anisotropy favouring the transverse direction. Explanations for tissue stress have invoked differential elastic moduli, differential plastic deformation (so-called differential growth), and a phenomenon analogous to the maturation stress generated by secondary cell walls. None of these explanations has been validated. We suggest that understanding the role of stress anisotropy in plant growth requires a deeper understanding of the nature of stress in hierarchical, organic structures.},

  abstract = {Plant cell wall (CW) polysaccharides are responsible for the mechanical strength and growth of plant cells; however, the high-resolution structure and dynamics of the CW polysaccharides are still poorly understood because of the insoluble nature of these molecules. Here, we use 2D and 3D magic-angle-spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR (SSNMR) to investigate the structural role of pectins in the plant CW. Intact and partially depectinated primary CWs of Arabidopsis thaliana were uniformly labeled with 13C and their NMR spectra were compared. Recent 13C resonance assignment of the major polysaccharides in Arabidopsis thaliana CWs allowed us to determine the effects of depectination on the intermolecular packing and dynamics of the remaining wall polysaccharides. 2D and 3D correlation spectra show the suppression of pectin signals, confirming partial pectin removal by chelating agents and sodium carbonate. Importantly, higher cross peaks are observed in 2D and 3D 13C spectra of the depectinated CW, suggesting higher rigidity and denser packing of the remaining wall polysaccharides compared with the intact CW. 13C spin\textendash{}lattice relaxation times and 1H rotating-frame spin\textendash{}lattice relaxation times indicate that the polysaccharides are more rigid on both the nanosecond and microsecond timescales in the depectinated CW. Taken together, these results indicate that pectic polysaccharides are highly dynamic and endow the polysaccharide network of the primary CW with mobility and flexibility, which may be important for pectin functions. This study demonstrates the capability of multidimensional SSNMR to determine the intermolecular interactions and dynamic structures of complex plant materials under near-native conditions.

  abstract = {Summary
To control morphogenesis, molecular regulatory networks have to interfere with the mechanical properties of the individual cells of developing organs and tissues, but how this is achieved is not well known. We study this issue here in the shoot meristem of higher plants, a group of undifferentiated cells where complex changes in growth rates and directions lead to the continuous formation of new organs [1, 2]. Here, we show that the plant hormone auxin plays an important role in this process via a dual, local effect on the extracellular matrix, the cell wall, which determines cell shape. Our study reveals that auxin not only causes a limited reduction in wall stiffness but also directly interferes with wall anisotropy via the regulation of cortical microtubule dynamics. We further show that to induce growth isotropy and organ outgrowth, auxin somehow interferes with the cortical microtubule-ordering activity of a network of proteins, including AUXIN BINDING PROTEIN 1 and KATANIN 1. Numerical simulations further indicate that the induced isotropy is sufficient to amplify the effects of the relatively minor changes in wall stiffness to promote organogenesis and the establishment of new growth axes in a robust manner.},

  volume = {26},
  issn = {0960-9822},
  abstract = {Summary
Stomatal opening and closure depends on changes in turgor pressure acting within guard cells to alter cell shape [1]. The extent of these shape changes is limited by the mechanical properties of the cells, which will be largely dependent on the structure of the cell walls. Although it has long been observed that guard cells~are anisotropic due to differential thickening and the orientation of cellulose microfibrils [2], our understanding of the composition of the cell wall that allows them to undergo repeated swelling and deflation remains surprisingly poor. Here, we show that the walls of guard cells are rich in un-esterified pectins. We identify a pectin methylesterase gene, PME6, which is highly expressed in guard cells and required for stomatal function. pme6-1 mutant guard cells have walls enriched in~methyl-esterified pectin and show a decreased dynamic range in response to triggers of stomatal opening/closure, including elevated osmoticum, suggesting that abrogation of stomatal function reflects a mechanical change in the guard cell wall. Altered stomatal function leads to increased conductance and evaporative cooling, as well as~decreased plant growth. The growth defect of~the~pme6-1 mutant is rescued by maintaining the~plants in elevated CO2, substantiating gas exchange analyses, indicating that the mutant stomata can bestow an improved assimilation rate. Restoration of PME6 rescues guard cell wall~pectin methyl-esterification status, stomatal function, and plant growth. Our results establish a~link~between gene expression in guard cells and~their cell wall properties, with a corresponding~effect on stomatal function and plant physiology.},

Stomata are a unique system to study both processes because stomatal maturation involves limited separation between sister guard cells and stomatal responses require reversible guard cell elongation and contraction. However, the molecular mechanisms for how stomatal pores form and how guard cell walls facilitate dynamic stomatal responses remain poorly understood. We characterized POLYGALACTURONASE INVOLVED IN EXPANSION3 (PGX3), which is expressed in expanding tissues and guard cells. PGX3-GFP localizes to the cell wall and is enriched at sites of stomatal pore initiation in cotyledons. In seedlings, ablating or overexpressing PGX3 affects both cotyledon shape and the spacing and pore dimensions of developing stomata. In adult plants, PGX3 affects rosette size. Although stomata in true leaves display normal density and morphology when PGX3 expression is altered, loss of PGX3 prevents smooth stomatal closure, and overexpression of PGX3 accelerates stomatal opening. These phenotypes correspond with changes in pectin molecular mass and abundance that can affect wall mechanics. Together, these results demonstrate that PGX3-mediated pectin degradation affects stomatal development in cotyledons, promotes rosette expansion, and modulates guard cell mechanics in adult plants.},

  volume = {27},
  issn = {0960-9822},
  abstract = {Summary
It has long been accepted that differential radial thickening of guard cells plays an important role~in the turgor-driven shape changes required for stomatal pore opening to occur [1, 2, 3, 4]. This textbook description derives from an original interpretation of structure rather than measurement of mechanical properties. Here we show, using atomic force microscopy, that although mature guard cells display a radial gradient of stiffness, this is not present in immature guard cells, yet young stomata show a normal opening response. Finite element modeling supports the experimental observation that radial stiffening plays a very limited role in stomatal opening. In addition, our analysis reveals an unexpected stiffening of the polar regions of the stomata complexes, both in Arabidopsis and other plants, suggesting a widespread occurrence. Combined experimental data (analysis of guard cell wall epitopes and treatment of tissue with cell wall digesting enzymes, coupled with bioassay of guard cell function) plus modeling lead us to propose that polar stiffening reflects a mechanical, pectin-based pinning down of the guard cell ends, which restricts increase of stomatal complex length during opening. This is predicted to lead to an improved response sensitivity of stomatal aperture movement with respect to change of turgor pressure. Our results provide new insight into the mechanics of stomatal function, both negating an established view of the importance of radial thickening and providing evidence for a significant role for polar stiffening. Improved stomatal performance via altered cell-wall-mediated mechanics is likely to be of evolutionary and agronomic significance.},

  abstract = {Xyloglucan is widely believed to function as a tether between cellulose microfibrils in the primary cell wall, limiting cell enlargement by restricting the ability of microfibrils to separate laterally. To test the biomechanical predictions of this ``tethered network'' model, we assessed the ability of cucumber (Cucumis sativus) hypocotyl walls to undergo creep (long-term, irreversible extension) in response to three family-12 endo-{$\beta$}-1,4-glucanases that can specifically hydrolyze xyloglucan, cellulose, or both. Xyloglucan-specific endoglucanase (XEG from Aspergillus aculeatus) failed to induce cell wall creep, whereas an endoglucanase that hydrolyzes both xyloglucan and cellulose (Cel12A from Hypocrea jecorina) induced a high creep rate. A cellulose-specific endoglucanase (CEG from Aspergillus niger) did not cause cell wall creep, either by itself or in combination with XEG. Tests with additional enzymes, including a family-5 endoglucanase, confirmed the conclusion that to cause creep, endoglucanases must cut both xyloglucan and cellulose. Similar results were obtained with measurements of elastic and plastic compliance. Both XEG and Cel12A hydrolyzed xyloglucan in intact walls, but Cel12A could hydrolyze a minor xyloglucan compartment recalcitrant to XEG digestion. Xyloglucan involvement in these enzyme responses was confirmed by experiments with Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) hypocotyls, where Cel12A induced creep in wild-type but not in xyloglucan-deficient (xxt1/xxt2) walls. Our results are incompatible with the common depiction of xyloglucan as a load-bearing tether spanning the 20- to 40-nm spacing between cellulose microfibrils, but they do implicate a minor xyloglucan component in wall mechanics. The structurally important xyloglucan may be located in limited regions of tight contact between microfibrils.},

Dicotyledonous primary (growing) cell walls contain cellulose, xyloglucan, pectin and proteins, but little is known about how each polymer class contributes to the cell wall mechanical properties that control extensibility.
Results: We present evidence that the degree of pectin methyl-esterification (DE\%) limits cell growth, and that a minimum level of about 60\% DE is required for normal cell elongation in Arabidopsis hypocotyls. When the average DE\% falls below this level, as in two gibberellic acid (GA) mutants ga1-3 and gai, and plants expressing pectin methyl-esterase (PME1) from Aspergillus aculeatus, then hypocotyl elongation is reduced.
Conclusion: Low average levels of pectin DE\% are associated with reduced cell elongation, implicating PMEs, the enzymes that regulate DE\%, in the cell elongation process and in responses to GA. At high average DE\% other components of the cell wall limit GA-induced growth.},

GalAT activity in homogenates from pea (Pisum sativum L. var. Alaska) stem internodes co-localized in linear and discontinuous sucrose gradients with latent UDPase activity, an enzyme marker specific for Golgi membranes. GalAT activity was separated from antimycin A-insensitive NADH:cytochromec reductase and cytochrome c oxidase activities, enzyme markers for the endoplasmic reticulum and the mitochondria, respectively. GalAT and latent UDPase activities were separated from the majority (80\%) of callose synthase activity, a marker for the plasma membrane, suggesting that little or no GalAT is present in the plasma membrane. GalAT activities in proteinase K-treated and untreated Golgi vesicles were similar, whereas no GalAT activity was detected after treating Golgi vesicles with proteinase K in the presence of Triton X-100. These results demonstrate that the catalytic site of GalAT resides within the lumen of the Golgi. The products generated by Golgi-localized GalAT were converted by endopolygalacturonase treatment to mono- and di-galacturonic acid, thereby showing that GalAT synthesizes 1\textrightarrow4-linked {$\alpha$}-d-galacturonan. Our data provide the first enzymatic evidence that a glycosyltransferase involved in HGA synthesis is present in the Golgi apparatus. Together with prior results of in vivo labeling and immunocytochemical studies, these results show that pectin biosynthesis occurs in the Golgi.

The detailed structure of the hemicelluloses and their abundance vary widely between different species and cell types. The most important biological role of hemicelluloses is their contribution to strengthening the cell wall by interaction with cellulose and, in some walls, with lignin.

Here, we characterize two Arabidopsis thaliana lines with altered expression of the POLYGALACTURONASE INVOLVED IN EXPANSION1 (PGX1) gene, which encodes a polygalacturonase that cleaves homogalacturonan (HG). PGX1AT plants overexpress PGX1, have HG with lower molecular weight, and grow larger, whereas pgx1-2 knockout plants have HG with higher molecular weight and grow smaller. Quantitative 13C solid-state NMR spectra show that PGX1AT cell walls have lower galacturonic acid and xylose contents and higher HG methyl esterification than controls, whereas high molecular weight pgx1-2 walls have similar galacturonic acid content and methyl esterification as controls. 1Htransferred 13C INEPT spectra indicate that the interfibrillar HG backbones are more aggregated whereas the RG-I side chains are more dispersed in PGX1AT cell walls than in pgx1-2 walls. In contrast, the pectins that are close to cellulose become more mobile and have weaker cross peaks with cellulose in PGX1AT walls than in pgx1-2 walls. Together, these results show that polygalacturonase-mediated plant growth is accompanied by increased esterification and decreased cross-linking of HG, increased aggregation of interfibrillar HG, and weaker HG-cellulose interactions. These structural and dynamical differences give molecular insights into how pectins influence wall dynamics during cell growth.},

  abstract = {The native cellulose of bacterial, algal, and animal origins has been well studied structurally using X-ray and neutron diffraction and solid-state NMR spectroscopy, and is known to consist of varying proportions of two allomorphs, I{$\alpha$} and I{$\beta$}, which differ in hydrogen bonding, chain packing, and local conformation. In comparison, cellulose structure in plant primary cell walls is much less understood because plant cellulose has lower crystallinity and extensive interactions with matrix polysaccharides. Here we have combined two-dimensional magic-angle-spinning (MAS) solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (solid-state NMR) spectroscopy at high magnetic fields with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to obtain detailed information about the structural polymorphism and spatial distributions of plant primary-wall cellulose. 2D 13C-13C correlation spectra of uniformly 13C-labeled cell walls of several model plants resolved seven sets of cellulose chemical shifts. Among these, five sets (denoted a-e) belong to cellulose in the interior of the microfibril while two sets (f and g) can be assigned to surface cellulose. Importantly, most of the interior cellulose 13C chemical shifts differ significantly from the 13C chemical shifts of the I{$\alpha$} and I{$\beta$} allomorphs, indicating that plant primary-wall cellulose has different conformations, packing, and hydrogen bonding from celluloses of other organisms. 2D 13C-13C correlation experiments with long mixing times and with water polarization transfer revealed the spatial distributions and matrix-polysaccharide interactions of these cellulose structures. Celluloses f and g are well mixed chains on the microfibril surface, celluloses a and b are interior chains that are in molecular contact with the surface chains, while cellulose c resides in the core of the microfibril, outside spin diffusion contact with the surface. Interestingly, cellulose d, whose chemical shifts differ most significantly from those of bacterial, algal, and animal cellulose, interacts with hemicellulose, is poorly hydrated, and is targeted by the protein expansin during wall loosening. To obtain information about the C6 hydroxymethyl conformation of these plant celluloses, we carried out DFT calculations of 13C chemical shifts, using the I{$\alpha$} and I{$\beta$} crystal structures as templates and varying the C5-C6 torsion angle. Comparison with the experimental chemical shifts suggests that all interior cellulose favor the tg conformation, but cellulose d also has a similar propensity to adopt the gt conformation. These results indicate that cellulose in plant primary cell walls, due to their interactions with matrix polysaccharides, and has polymorphic structures that are not a simple superposition of the I{$\alpha$} and I{$\beta$} allomorphs, thus distinguishing them from bacterial and animal celluloses.},

  abstract = {Summary
A landmark of developmental biology is the production of reproducible shapes, through stereotyped morphogenetic events. At the cell level, growth is often highly heterogeneous, allowing shape diversity to arise. Yet, how can reproducible shapes emerge from such growth heterogeneity? Is growth heterogeneity filtered out? Here, we focus on rapidly growing trichome cells in the Arabidopsis sepal, a reproducible floral organ. We show via computational modeling that rapidly growing cells may distort organ shape. However, the cortical microtubule alignment along growth-derived maximal tensile stress in adjacent cells would mechanically isolate rapidly growing cells and limit their impact on organ shape. In~vivo, we observed such microtubule response to stress and consistently found no significant effect of trichome number on sepal shape in wild-type and lines with trichome number defects. Conversely, modulating the microtubule response to stress in~katanin and spiral2 mutant made sepal shape dependent on trichome number, suggesting that, while mechanical signals are propagated around rapidly growing cells, the resistance to stress in~adjacent cells mechanically isolates rapidly growing cells, thus contributing to organ shape reproducibility.},

  abstract = {Fractals have the potential to describe complex microstructures but presently no solution methodologies exist for the prediction of deformation on transiently deforming fractal structures. This is achieved in this paper with the development of analytical solutions on vibrating composite rods and beams. The fractals considered are necessarily deterministic and relatively simple in form to demonstrate the solution methodology. The solutions are limited to beams and rods constructed from an idealised-composite material consisting of relatively large rigid particles embedded in an infinitely thin pliable matrix. Although, as a result, the fractal composite system is not representative of a realistic physical system the methodologies presented do serve to highlight the practical difficulties in using fractals in structural dynamics. Static loading is restricted to spatially invariant axial forces and bending moments as solutions on a unified state of continuum stress are sought which then serve as initial conditions for the vibratory problem. It is demonstrated that measurable displacement is possible on a fractal structure and that finite measures of total, kinetic and strain energy are simultaneously achievable. The approach involves the use of modal analysis to determine modes at natural frequencies that satisfy boundary conditions. These are combined to provide a free vibration solution on a fractal that satisfies the initial conditions in the form of a fractal displacement field.},

  abstract = {Small deformation dynamic rheometry was used to characterise the calcium-induced gelation of low-methoxyl pectins, at two different pH values. The gelation kinetics was interpreted with basis on the change of the storage modulus with time, taken as a measure of changes in cross-linking density within the pectin \textendash{} calcium network. The temperature influence on the rate of gel formation and ageing was evaluated, as well as the temperature sensitivity of the cured gels. The formation and the softening/melting of pectin \textendash{}calcium networks were also studied under non-isothermal conditions. The structural diversity of the two pectin samples had a great influence on the gelation kinetics and thermal behaviour of these pectin\textendash{} calcium networks, due to differences in the steric arrangement or environment and/or availability of the chelating groups. An association mechanism is suggested to predominate under conditions of low availability of dissociated carboxylic groups, due to a low pH, higher degree of methylation, or steric constraints introduced by acetylation or neutral side chains, different from the classical `egg-box' model, and where non-ionic hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions may co-exist and cooperate with coordinative binding of calcium-ions.},

  abstract = {Fully de-esterified pectin with excellent gelling properties was isolated in the sodium-salt form from fresh `nopal' cactus (Opuntia ficus indica) pads (0.6\% w/w yield of fresh weight) using an alkaline extraction medium in the presence of a sequestering agent. Sugars composition of the cactus pectin alkaline extract (CPAE) was: 85.4\% uronic acids, 7.0\% galactose, 6.0\% arabinose and minor quantities of rhamnose and xylose. Features of the Fourier-transformed infrared spectrum were nearly identical to those of commercial citrus pectin as well as to homogalacturan-rich pectin isolated from prickly pear, lime peel, and sugar beet pulp. The gelling behavior of this material was studied as a function of amount of Ca2+ added and temperature by dynamic oscillatory rheology. Addition of Ca2+ at 85 \textdegree{}C was adjusted at varying stoichiometric ratios, R (=2 [Ca2+]/[COO{\`A}]), namely 0.07, 0.21, 0.35 and 0.42 and fixed pectin concentration (16 g/ L), and a temperature dependent behavior of the system on cooling was imposed. Evolution of the viscoelastic storage (G0) and loss (G0 0 moduli on cooling revealed unequivocal set up of a gel network under a highly cooperative sol-gel transition at R 6 0.21. At greater R values, the Ca2+-mediated dimeric association of pectin chains led to formation of a gel network even at 85 \textdegree{}C. On heating, pectin gels melted partially at temperatures notably greater than those at which they were formed. Thermal hysteresis observed between the cooling and heating temperature traces is explained in terms of helix\textendash{}helix aggregation. The gelling behavior of this system is interpreted in terms of the formation of two distinct types of junctions mediated by the stoichiometric amount of calcium (R). Namely, short `egg-box' type junctions formed directly at high temperature on addition of calcium (limited zones are related to high mobility of the chains) and highly cooperative 21 helix junctions followed by aggregation formed at lower temperature under a thermal conformational transition driven by charge neutralization and lower chain mobility (related to stabilization by H-bonds).},

The microscopic dynamics obtained with photon correlation imaging, a novel optical technique that allows obtaining the microscopic dynamics of the sample while retaining the spatial resolution of imaging techniques, is contrasted with macroscopic rheological measurements at constant strain. Pectin gelation is found to display peculiar two-stage kinetics, highlighted by non-monotonic growth in time of both microscopic correlations and gel mechanical strength. These results are compared to those found for alginate, another biopolymer extensively used in food formulation.},

  abstract = {Self-assembled hydrogen-bonded networks of the polysaccharide pectin, a mechanically functional component of plant cell walls, have been of recent interest as biomimetic exemplars of physical gels, and the microrheological and strainstiffening behaviors have been previously investigated. Despite this detailed rheological characterization of preformed gels, little is known about the fundamental arrangement of the polymers into cross-linking junction zones, the size of these bonded regions, and the resultant network architecture in these hydrogen-bonded materials, especially in contrast to the plethora of such information available for their well-known calcium-assembled counterparts. In this work, in concert with pertinent rheological measurements, an in-depth structural study of the hydrogen-bond-mediated gelation of pectins is provided. Gels were realized by using glucona-deltalactone to decrease the pH of solutions of pectic polymers that had a (blockwise) low degree of methylesterification. Small-angle X-ray scattering and transmission electron microscopy were utilized to access structural information on length scales on the order of nanometers to hundreds of nanometers, while complementary mechanical properties were measured predominantly using small amplitude oscillatory shear rheology.},

Estimation of the degree of methylesterification (DM) and quantification of the pattern of methylester distribution in terms of absolute degree of blockiness (DBabs) enabled the characterisation of pectins. Characterised pectins were used for the preparation of Ca2+-pectin gels with varying calcium ion (Ca2+) concentration. The rheological characteristics of produced gels were evaluated by means of small-amplitude oscillatory tests. During gel formation, gel strength was monitored so as to allow assessment of network development. Based on the evaluation of mechanical spectra, the nature of the cured gels was established. Depending on Ca2+ concentration as well as DM and DBabs, gels prepared from specific C-pectins (48{$\geq$}DM{$\geq$}26\%; 9{$\leq$}DBabs{$\leq$}37\%) and F-pectins (64{$\geq$}DM{$\geq$}29\%; 9{$\leq$}DBabs{$\leq$}50\%) showed a striking decrease of the gel strength with time, while gel networks produced from other pectins either displayed a continuous increase of the gel strength or verged towards pseudo-equilibrium within the observation time of 5h. Furthermore, the DM, DBabs and Ca2+ concentration influenced the evolution of Ca2+-pectin networks from ``structured liquids'' to ``strong gels''. Based on the experimental results, specific mechanisms of Ca2+ interactions with pectins were (also) considered.},

In this study, the influence of these ``mixed'' patterns of methylesterification on the rheological characteristics of Ca2+-gels is extensively examined, using partially methylesterified poly-d-galacturonic acid (mPGA) as a model for homogalacturonan. The uncontrolled pattern of methylesterification induced on mPGA was combined with that resulting from subsequent controlled chemical or enzymatic de-esterification. Afterwards, the produced mPGAs were characterised in terms of degree and pattern of methylesterification. The latter structural feature was quantified as ``absolute degree of blockiness'' through enzymatic fingerprinting. Characterised mPGAs were used for the preparation of gels with various calcium ion (Ca2+) concentrations. All Ca2+-pectin systems formed ``true'' gels with a strong elastic behaviour, but vary in gel stiffness. The gels' rheological characteristics not only depend on the extent of mPGA de-esterification, but also on the ``mixed'' patterns of methylesterification. The experimental results also indicate that extremely short non-cooperative junction zones contribute to the stiffness of Ca2+-mPGA gels.},

  abstract = {A new method for the examination of the pectin gelation process is presented as a complementation of the most common determination of the gelling point (cross-over of G{${'}$} and G{${''}$}) from oscillation measurements. It is based on the first derivation dG{${'}$}/dt from oscillation measurements (named as structuring velocity), and defines an initial as well as a critical structuring temperature. These allow an exact determination of the start of structure formation and description of the structuring process also in gels with pre-gelation that showed no clear GP. Moreover, phases and mechanisms of gelation can be identified and structure developing rates can be calculated. The application of this method on the gelation of low-methoxylated pectin at pH 3 and 30\% saccharose with different contents of Ca2+ was tested. The results show differences as well as similarities between the GP and the newly defined structuring parameters that could be partly explained by varying structuring mechanisms at different Ca-content. The initial structuring process started probably with ionic interactions (egg-box junction zones and random crosslinks) via Ca-bridges as well as hydrophobic interactions at temperatures{$\geq$}60\textdegree{}C, it was nearly completed around 40\textdegree{}C. Hydrophilic interactions (below 50\textdegree{}C) and inter-dimer aggregations (below 25\textdegree{}C) perhaps dominated the gelation during further cooling. In dependence on the Ca-content, two to three phases could be identified during the structuring process. The properties of the gels after cooling were tested by oscillation measurements as well as the USA-sag method. With increasing calcium content the elastic behaviour of the gels increased but they became also more and more brittle.},

Accordingly, a highly methyl-esterified pectin was selectively de-esterified using NaOH, plant or fungal pectin methylesterase in order to produce series of pectins with varied pattern and broad ranges of methylesterification. The PM was quantified as absolute degree of blockiness (DBabs). Ca2+-pectin gels were prepared at various Ca2+ concentrations. Gel stiffness (G{${'}$} at 1rad/s) was determined and mapped out as a function of DM, DBabs and Ca2+ concentration. At low Ca2+ concentrations, G{${'}$} depends on polymer's DM and DBabs. At high Ca2+ concentrations, a master curve is obtained over a wide range of DM, irrespective of DBabs. Depending on methylesterification pattern, increase of G{${'}$} is related not only to an increase in the number of junction zones per pectin chain, but also to an increase in the size of junction zones and the number of dimerised chains occurring in the gels. These results provide a detailed insight into the occurrence of junction zones in Ca2+-pectin gels.},

  abstract = {When calcium salts are added to an aqueous solution of polysaccharide pectin, ionic cross-links form between pectin chains, giving rise to a gel network in dilute solution. In this work, dynamic light scattering (DLS) is employed to study the microscopic dynamics of the fractal aggregates (flocs) that constitute the gels, while rheological measurements are carried out to study the process of gel rupture. As the calcium salt concentration is increased, DLS experiments reveal that the polydispersity of the flocs increase simultaneously with the characteristic relaxation times of the gel network. Above a critical salt concentration, the flocs become interlinked to form a reaction-limited fractal gel network. Rheological studies demonstrate that the limits of the linear rheological response and the critical stresses required to rupture these networks both decrease with the increase in salt concentration. These features indicate that the ion-mediated pectin gels studied here lie in a `strong link' regime that is characterised by inter-floc links that are stronger than intra-floc links. A scaling analysis of the experimental data presented here demonstrates that the elasticities of the individual fractal flocs exhibit power-law dependences on the added salt concentration. We conclude that when both pectin and salt concentrations are increased, the number of fractal flocs of pectin increases simultaneously with the density of crosslinks, giving rise to very large values of the bulk elastic modulus.},

  abstract = {Controlled drug delivery remains a research focus for public health to enhance patient compliance, drug efficiency and reduce the side effects of drugs. Pectin, an edible plant polysaccharide, has been shown to be useful for the construction of drug delivery systems for specific drug delivery. Several pectin derived formulations have been developed in our laboratory and tested in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo for the ability to deliver bioactive substances for therapeutic purposes in the context of interactions with living tissues. Pectin derivatives carrying primary amine groups were more mucoadhesive and have shown potential in nasal drug delivery and other mucosal drug delivery. Pectin derivatives with highly esterified galacturonic acid residues are more hydrophobic and able to sustain the release of incorporated fragrances for a prolonged duration. Less esterified pectin derivatives are able to penetrate deeper into the skin and may be useful in aromatherapy formulations. Pectin, in combination with zein, a corn protein, forms hydrogel beads. The bound zein restricts bead swelling and retains the porosity of the beads; the pectin networks shield the zein from protease attack. The complex beads are ideal vehicles for colon-specific drug delivery. Studies presented in this paper indicate the flexibility and possibility to tailor pectin macromolecules into a variety of drug delivery systems to meet different clinical requirements.},

  abstract = {The nanostructure of calcium-low-methoxyl-pectin gels is still not fully understood despite its wide use in food and biomedical devices. In this study we present a comprehensive small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis of calcium\textendash{}pectin gels with various calcium concentrations. Several modeling approaches were examined taking into account the contribution from both junction zones and chains between cross-links. The SAXS studies are supplemented by determination of the gels' mechanical properties and swelling behavior. The model of semiflexible chains without excluded volume effects was found to be most suitable for describing calcium\textendash{}pectin gels. The SAXS analysis suggests that both rod-like junction zones and point-like cross-links between neighboring chains are formed in calcium\textendash{}pectin gels. Moreover, as the calcium content increases, the number of the rod-like junction zones decreases while the number of the point-like cross-links increases.},

It considers two outstanding phases of study: the extraction of high-grade pectin (highly polymerized pectin), and the production of partially deesterified pectins or pectinic acids. A description of these two phases and their practical application to the food industry has been given. The relative effects of the variation of time, temperature, and pH in the extraction of pectin have been extensively investigated. Modifications in extraction procedure have been suggested, such as the use of alkyl or aryl esters of aliphatic or aromatic acids, and xylene. The quality of pectins can be approximated by viscosity measurements. The viscosity of water solutions is dependent upon several factors, mainly, concentration, pH, and degree of polymerization. A complete discussion of gelation is presented dealing with de-esterification. The extraction of high-grade pectins and the possible preparations of new compounds as a result of partial deesterification of pectins are two developments which play an important role in fruit by-product utilization.},

  abstract = {Gene expression can be noisy, as can the growth of single cells. Such cell-to-cell variation has been implicated in survival strategies for bacterial populations. However, it remains unclear how single cells couple gene expression with growth to implement these survival strategies. Here we show how noisy expression of a key stress response regulator, rpoS, allows E. coli to modulate its growth dynamics to survive future adverse environments. First, we demonstrate that rpoS has a long-tailed distribution of expression in an unstressed population of cells. We next reveal how a dynamic positive feedback loop between rpoS and growth rate produces multi-generation rpoS pulses, which are responsible for the rpoS heterogeneity. We do so experimentally with single-cell, time-lapse microscopy and microfluidics and theoretically with a stochastic model. Finally, we demonstrate the function of the coupling of heterogeneous rpoS activity and growth. It enables E. coli to survive oxidative attack by causing prolonged periods of slow growth. This dynamic phenotype is captured by the rpoS-growth feedback model. Our synthesis of noisy gene expression, growth, and survival paves the way for further exploration of functional phenotypic variability.},

  abstract = {Cellular morphogenesis involves changes to cellular size and shape which in the case of walled cells implies the mechanical deformation of the extracellular matrix. So far, technical challenges have made quantitative mechanical measurements of this process at subcellular scale impossible. We used micro-indentation to investigate the dynamic changes in the cellular mechanical properties during the onset of spatially confined growth activities in plant cells. Pollen tubes are cellular protuberances that have a strictly unidirectional growth pattern. Micro-indentation of these cells revealed that the initial formation of a cylindrical protuberance is preceded by a local reduction in cellular stiffness. Similar cellular softening was observed before the onset of a rapid growth phase in cells with oscillating growth pattern. These findings provide the first quantitative cytomechanical data that confirm the important role of the mechanical properties of the cell wall for local cellular growth processes. They are consistent with a conceptual model that explains pollen tube oscillatory growth based on the relationship between turgor pressure and tensile resistance in the apical cell wall. To further confirm the significance of cell mechanics, we artificially manipulated the mechanical cell wall properties as well as the turgor pressure. We observed that these changes affected the oscillation profile and were able to induce oscillatory behavior in steadily growing tubes.},

  abstract = {Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) QUARTET (QRT) genes are required for pollen separation during normal floral development. In qrt mutants, the four products of microsporogenesis remain fused and pollen grains are released as tetrads. In Arabidopsis, tetrad analysis in qrt mutants has been used to map all five centromeres, easily distinguish sporophytic from gametophytic mutations, and accurately assess crossover interference. Using a combination of forward and reverse genetics, we have identified the gene responsible for the qrt1 phenotype. Annotation predicts that QRT1 encodes a pectin methylesterase (PME), and enzymatic assays of QRT1 expressed in Escherichia coli indicate that QRT1 has PME activity. Promoter and transcription analysis demonstrate QRT1 is expressed in anther tissues shortly after meiosis is complete. Unexpectedly, the QRT1 promoter is also active in a variety of developmentally unrelated tissues, including developing guard cells, the hypocotyl-root transition zone, areas of lateral root emergence, and floral nectaries. PMEs constitute a large gene family in Arabidopsis, are involved in cell wall loosening, and have been implicated in various aspects of floral development and pollen tube elongation. The identification of QRT1 as a PME contributes to our understanding of pollen development and may help to provide valuable genetic tools in other plant species.},

  volume = {222},
  issn = {1432-2048},
  abstract = {An insertion in the promoter of the Arabidopsis thaliana QUA1 gene (qua1-1 allele) leads to a dwarf plant phenotype and a reduction in cell adhesion, particularly between epidermal cells in seedlings and young leaves. This coincides with a reduction in the level of homogalacturonan epitopes and the amount of GalA in isolated cell walls (Bouton et al., Plant Cell 14: 2577 2002). The present study was undertaken in order to investigate further the link between QUA1 and cell wall biosynthesis. We have used rapidly elongating inflorescence stems to compare cell wall biosynthesis in wild type and qua1-1 mutant tissue. Relative to the wild type, homogalacturonan {$\alpha$}-1-4-D-galacturonosyltransferase activity was consistently reduced in qua1-1 stems (by about 23\% in microsomal and 33\% in detergent-solubilized membrane preparations). Activities of {$\beta$}-1-4-D-xylan synthase, {$\beta$}-1-4-D-galactan synthase and {$\beta$}-glucan synthase II activities were also measured in microsomal membranes. Of these, only {$\beta$}-1-4-D-xylan synthase was affected, and was reduced by about 40\% in qua1-1 stems relative to wild type. The mutant phenotype was apparent in inflorescence stems, and was investigated in detail using microscopy and cell wall composition analyses. Using in situ PCR techniques, QUA1 mRNA was localized to discrete cells of the vascular tissue and subepidermal layers. In mutant stems, the organization of these tissues was disrupted and there was a modest reduction in homogalacturonan (JIM5) epitopes. This study demonstrates a specific role for QUA1 in the development of vascular tissue in rapidly elongating inflorescence stems and supports a role of QUA1 in pectin and hemicellulose cell wall synthesis through affects on {$\alpha$}-1,4-D-galacturonosyltransferase and {$\beta$}-1,4-D-xylan synthase activities.},

Waste materials from industries such as food processing and agriculture may act as biosorbents. This study investigates the removal of cadmium by fruit wastes (derived from several citrus fruits, apples and grapes). Citrus peels were identified as the most promising biosorbent due to high metal uptake in conjunction with physical stability. Uptake was rapid with equilibrium reached after 30\textendash{}80min depending on the particle size (0.18\textendash{}0.9mm). Sorption kinetics followed a second-order model. Sorption equilibrium isotherms could be described by the Langmuir model in some cases, whereas in others an S-shaped isotherm was observed, that did not follow the Langmuir isotherm model. The metal uptake increased with pH, with uptake capacities ranging between 0.5 and 0.9meq/g of dry peel. Due to their low cost, good uptake capacity, and rapid kinetics, citrus peels are a promising biosorbent material warranting further study.},

  abstract = {This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of modified citrus pectin (MCP) on the urinary excretion of toxic elements in healthy individuals. MCP is a reduced molecular weight pectin (weight-average molar mass = 15400) that is mostly linear homogalacturonan with a 3.8\% degree of esterification and approximately 10\% rhamnogalacturonan II based on the presence of 2-keto-3-deoxy-octonic acid. Subjects ingested 15 g of MCP (PectaSol\textregistered, EcoNugenics\textregistered{} Inc., Santa Rosa, California 95407) each day for 5 days and 20 g on day 6. Twenty-four hour urine samples were collected on day 1 and day 6 for comparison with baseline. The urine samples were analysed for toxic and essential elements. In the first 24 h of MCP administration the urinary excretion of arsenic increased significantly (130\%, p {$<$} 0.05). On day 6, urinary excretion was increased significantly for cadmium (150\%, p {$<$} 0.05). In addition, lead showed a dramatic increase in excretion (560\%, p {$<$} 0.08). This pilot trial provides the first evidence that oral administration of MCP increases significantly the urinary excretion of toxic metals in subjects with a `normal' body load of metals. It is suggested that systemic chelation of toxic metals by MCP may in part be attributable to the presence of rhamnogalacturonan II, which has been shown previously to chelate metals.

  abstract = {Background/Objectives:Viscous fibers typically reduce total cholesterol (TC) by 3\textendash{}7\% in humans. The cholesterol-lowering properties of the viscous fiber pectin may depend on its physico-chemical properties (viscosity, molecular weight (MW) and degree of esterification (DE)), but these are not typically described in publications, nor required by European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) with respect to its generic pectin cholesterol-lowering claim.Subjects/Methods:Here, different sources and types of well-characterized pectin were evaluated in humans. Cross-over studies were completed in mildly hyper-cholesterolemic persons receiving either 15 g/day pectin or cellulose with food for 4 weeks.Results:Relative low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering was as follows: citrus pectin DE-70=apple pectin DE-70 (7\textendash{}10\% reduction versus control){$>$}apple pectin DE-35=citrus pectin DE-35{$>$}OPF (orange pulp fiber) DE-70 and low-MW pectin DE-70{$>$}citrus DE-0. In a subsequent 3-week trial with 6 g/day pectin, citrus DE-70 and high MW pectin DE-70 reduced LDL-C 6\textendash{}7\% versus control (without changes in TC). In both studies, high DE and high MW were important for cholesterol lowering. Source may also be important as citrus and apple DE-70 pectin were more effective than OPF DE-70 pectin. Pectin did not affect inflammatory markers high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) nor plasma homocysteine.Conclusions:Pectin source and type (DE and MW) affect cholesterol lowering. The EFSA pectin cholesterol-lowering claim should require a minimum level of characterization, including DE and MW.},

  abstract = {Plant and their products have always been a source of various drugs and excipients used in pharmaceutical formulations. Pectin, a naturally occurring polysaccharide, has in recent years gained increased importance. The benefits of natural pectin are also appreciated by scientists and consumer due to its biodegradability. Pectin is the methylated ester of polygalacturonic acid and it is commercially extracted from citrus peels and apple pomace under mildly acidic conditions. Pectin is divided into two major groups on the basis of their degree of esterification. The association of pectin chains leads to the formation of the three dimensional networks giving gel formation. Since ages pectin is being used in the formulation of various dosage forms wherein it acts as a promising natural polymer for drug delivery. Pectin possesses several requisite characteristics to be used as polymer in drug development and release kinetics. In the present review we have compiled the major sources, extraction process and properties of pectin. The major fields and areas of its applications as a promising polymer have also been discussed. The pectin, by itself or by its gelling properties, is employed in pharmaceutical industry as a carrier for drug delivery to the gastrointestinal tract, such as matrix tablets, gel beads, film-coated dosage form. This review has also discussed the important chemistry and general properties of pectin, and its gel formation mechanism and properties.},

Parameters derived from the rheological measurements comprised the gel point, structuring velocity, initial and critical structuring temperature, average structuring developing rate and loss factor (tan{$\delta$}end). The influence of the cooling rate on the gelling process of LMP was moderate and the influence on the final gel properties was significant, tan{$\delta$}end decreased with increasing cooling rate. The calcium content significantly affected the structuring process of LMAP and the final gel properties. At high calcium content, the gelling process started at a higher temperature but the resulting gels were less strong. The pH had a significant but partly opposite effect on the gelation of LMP as well as LMAP. The differences in gelation behavior between LMP and LMAP can be explained by the lower number of available blocks of free carboxyl groups in LMAP as well as by the formation of additional hydrogen bonds through the amide groups.},

  volume = {6},

  abstract = {In the present review, we describe current knowledge about synthesis of borate crosslinked rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II) and it physiological roles. RG-II is a portion of pectic polysaccharide with high complexity, present in primary cell wall. It is composed of homogalacturonan backbone and four distinct side chains (A-D). Borate forms ester bonds with the apiosyl residues of side chain A of two RG-II monomers to generate borate dimerized RG-II, contributing for the formation of networks of pectic polysaccharides. In plant cell walls, more than 90\% of RG-II are dimerized by borate under B sufficient conditions. Borate crosslinking of RG-II in primary cell walls, to our knowledge, is the only experimentally proven molecular function of boron (B), an essential trace-element. Although abundance of RG-II and B is quite small in cell wall polysaccharides, increasing evidence supports that RG-II and its borate crosslinking are critical for plant growth and development. Significant advancement was made recently on the location and the mechanisms of RG-II synthesis and borate cross-linking. Molecular genetic studies have successfully identified key enzymes for RG-II synthesis and regulators including B transporters required for efficient formation of RG-II crosslinking and consequent normal plant growth. The present article focuses recent advances on (i) RG-II polysaccharide synthesis, (ii) occurrence of borate crosslinking and (iii) B transport for borate supply to RG-II. Molecular mechanisms underlying formation of borate RG-II crosslinking and the physiological impacts are discussed.},

  abstract = {Pectins are major polysaccharide components in plant cell walls and play various roles in plant development and growth. In order to understand how pectin associates with cellulose, different kinds of pectins varying in neutral sugar side-chain content and backbone homogalacturonan degree of esterification were used to study their interaction with cellulose during its synthesis by Gluconacetobacter xylinus (ATCC53524). Binding studies in the absence of calcium revealed that all types of pectin were able to bind to cellulose and confirmed that binding of pectin with a high content of neutral sugar side chains ({$\sim$}40\%) was greater than that of homogalacturonan (less than 7\% neutral sugars). 13C NMR revealed that associated pectin molecules were neither rigid nor affected cellulose crystallinity; furthermore no apparent change in cellulose architecture was observed in scanning electron micrographs. The binding was reversible as a result of water washing and the de-binding behaviour was dominated by surface permeability rather than diffusion within the pellicle, as suggested by model fitting. Irreversible deformation of composites occurred as a result of mechanical compression accompanied by the release of pectins, and our results showed that both cellulose and pectin contributed to the load-bearing capacity of composites during compression.},

B values between 0.072 and 0.017 indicate that pectins are relatively stiff molecules. However, an increase in flexibility is noticeable with the rise of the rhamnose content and of the amount of amide groups of the pectic acids. The flexibility is also sensitive to the degree of methylation.},

  volume = {2},
  issn = {0144-8617},
  abstract = {Low methoxyl pectins (LMP) have been manufactured since the 1940s primarily for use as gelling agents. At the time, it was noted that low methoxyl pectates (LMPs) prepared by different methods had different gelling properties and this was attributed to the way in which the free carboxyl groups were distributed along the chain following deesterification. Various workers have shown that LMP prepared by enzymic deesterification is more heterogeneous with respect to the degree of esterification (DE) than LMPs of the same DE prepared by acid deesterification. This, together with enzyme studies, has been taken as a sign that pectinesterase works in a sequential fashion and, similarly, acid deesterification is a random process. More recently, the preparation of crude enzyme-deesterified LMP, which is used as a thickener in canned goods, has been described. Although enzyme-deesterified LMPs appear to form weak gels with calcium ions at room temperature (acid-deesterified LMP/calcium gels are reported to be stronger) they are superior when incorporated into canned goods which receive a severe heat treatment. This review briefly describes the preparation of LMP and that work on LMP which provides information about the distribution of carboxyl groups in the pectate molecule. Since it is established that this distribution affects the gelling properties of the pectin a sound understanding of the chemical aspects may assist in understanding the mechanism of gelation.},

  abstract = {Two commercially extracted pectins having different physical properties but similar chemical characteristics were fractionated into subpopulations using ion exchange chromatography. Individual sub-populations were characterised using established strategies (galacturonic acid and neutral sugar content, degree of methyl-esterification) including the use of enzymes (endo- and exo-polygalacturonases) as analytical tool. Some purified populations showed similar degree of methyl-esterification whereas they were eluting at different ionic strength. It was shown that these populations mainly differed in the number of galacturonic acid moieties in `endo-polygalacturonase degradable blocks' and in the location of these blocks within the molecule. The size of the blocks present at the non-reducing end of the pectin was also different within the molecules. The separation of pectins on anion exchanger combined with the use of enzymes allowed us to differentiate pectic sub-populations. Commercial pectins appear to be a mixture of several polymers differing in total charge as well as in the distribution of the charges.},

It discusses the problems of processing and manufacture. On a commercial scale, storage conditions are important, and rheological problems often occur in canning. Not only do the conditions of storage have to be carefully controlled but in recent times, artificial processes that greatly accelerate ``ripening'' have been devised. Two key, and often quite distinct, considerations play their part in these processes: the direct significance of mechanical properties and indirect effects in which rheological properties reflect chemical and other conditions which are important in the manufacturing process. The chapter discusses natural aging processes that are essentially of two kinds. First there are processes induced by the presence of microorganisms. The second type of aging is fundamentally a colloidal phenomenon, and the changes are not primarily dependent on the activity of organisms. Aging processes accelerated by mechanical means have been discussed in the chapter. It discusses the importance of rheological conditions in cooking. It proposes to recapitulate briefly the rheological features involved in the cooking of a single meal. The chapter considers the rheology of certain foodstuffs as they reach the consumer as well as some problems concerned with the perception of rheological conditions when food is actually consumed.},

There are also the difficulties inherent in any multidisciplinary science like rheology for those with a specific training. Therefore, newcomers to the field are sometimes discouraged, and for them the existing texts on the subject - some of which are outstanding - are of limited assistance because of their depth of detail and highly mathematical nature.This book introduces the subject of rheology in terms understandable to non-experts and describes the application of rheological principles to many industrial products and processes. It provides a simple but authoritative guide which shows clearly how mathematics, physics and chemistry have contributed to the development of rheology. The generic features of all liquid-like materials are summarised, i.e. viscosity, linear viscoelasticity, normal stresses and extensional viscosity. Particular systems are then discussed, i.e. polymeric liquids and suspensions. The final chapter gives an outline of the theoretical advances which have been made. Consistent notation and nomenclature have been used throughout the book, and the key textbooks and publications which will enable the reader to follow up particular topics are listed.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Epithelial monolayers are one-cell thick tissue sheets that separate internal and external environments. As part of their function, they withstand extrinsic mechanical stresses applied at high strain rate. However, little is known about how monolayers respond to mechanical deformations. In stress relaxation tests, monolayers respond in a biphasic manner and stress dissipation is accompanied by an increase in monolayer resting length, pointing to active remodelling of cell architecture during relaxation. Consistent with this, actomyosin remodels at a rate commensurate with mechanical relaxation and governs the rate of monolayer stress relaxation - as in single cells. By contrast, junctional complexes and intermediate filaments form stable connections between cells, enabling monolayers to behave rheologically as single cells. Together, these data show actomyosin cytoskeletal dynamics govern the rheological properties of monolayers by enabling active, ATP-dependent changes in the resting length. These findings have far-reaching consequences for our understanding of developmental morphogenesis and tissue response to mechanical stress.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  title = {Computation of Fractional Derivatives Using {{Fourier}} Transform and Digital {{FIR}} Differentiator},
  volume = {80},
  issn = {0165-1684},
  abstract = {In this paper, the computation of a fractional derivative using the Fourier transform and a digital FIR differentiator is investigated. First, the Cauchy integral formula is generalized to define the fractional derivative of functions. Then the fractional differentiation property of the Fourier transform of functions is presented. Using this property, the fractional derivative of a function can be computed in the frequency domain. Next, we develop a least-squares method to design the fractional order digital differentiator. When a signal passes through the designed differentiator, the output will be its fractional derivative. One design example is included to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach. Finally, the designed fractional order differentiator is used to generate a random fractal process which is better than the process obtained by the conventional method.
Zusammenfassung
In diesem Artikel wird die Berechnung der fraktalen Ableitung unter Verwendung der Fouriertransformation und eines digitalen, transversalen Differentiators untersucht. Zun{\"a}chst wird die Formel des Cauchy-Integrals verallgemeinert, um die fraktale Ableitung von Funktionen zu definieren. Dann wird die fraktale Differenzierungseigenschaft der Fouriertransformation von Funktionen vorgestellt. Mittels dieser Eigenschaft kann die fraktale Ableitung einer Funktion im Frequenzbereich berechnet werden. Als n{\"a}chstes entwickeln wir eine Kleinste-Quadrate-Methode, um den digitalen Differentiator gebrochener Ordnung zu entwerfen. Wenn ein Signal den entworfenen Differentiator durchl{\"a}uft, wird das Ausgangssignal seine fraktale Ableitung sein. Ein Entwurfsbeispiel ist angegeben, um die Effektivit{\"a}t diese Methode zu veranschaulichen. Schlie{\ss}lich wird der entworfene Differentiator gebrochener Ordnung verwendet, um einen fraktalen, stochastischen Proze{\ss} zu generieren, der besser als der Proze{\ss} nach herk{\"o}mmlicher Methode ist.

The differentiation of vectors of data points representing discrete samples of some underlying signal can be implemented in a computer using the central differencing scheme or the fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based approach. We point out that a simple extension of the continuous Fourier transform derivative identity to the discrete case, however, gives rise to results that are inconsistent with the central differencing scheme. In particular, for functions with step-like discontinuities, the numerical derivative computed with the FFT-based approach is corrupted by ringing artifacts. We describe the idea of a modified wave number for FFT-based numerical differentiation which leads to results that are consistent with the central differencing scheme. Modified wave number identities for numerical computation of both first and second order derivatives are described. The pitfalls of using a simplistic extension of the derivative identity for continuous Fourier transform to the discrete case and the methodology to avoid them are illustrated with numerical examples.}

Most sequence alignment methods use an affine gap penalty to assign scores to insertions and deletions. Although affine gap penalties represent the relative ease of extending a gap compared with initializing a gap, it is still an obvious oversimplification of the real processes that occur during sequence evolution. To improve the efficiency of sequence alignment methods and to obtain a better understanding of the process of sequence evolution, we wanted to find a more accurate model of insertions and deletions in homologous proteins. In this work, we extract the probability of a gap occurrence and the resulting gap length distribution in distantly related proteins (sequence identity {$<$} 25\%) using alignments based on their common structures. We observe a distribution of gaps that can be fitted with a multiexponential with four distinct components. The results suggest new approaches to modeling insertions and deletions in sequence alignments. Proteins 2001;45:102\textendash{}104.},

The authors here extend earlier results to higher dimensions, focusing on the solution of the discrete diffusion or ``heat'' equation in 2-D, and show that the solution may be found using fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques that treat the solution as the output of a linear filter. This technique is analogous to an integral method for the differential equation, and is related to the Green's function of the difference equation. It allows the solution to be determined with a ``single-step'' computation that does not require the solution at intermediate time levels. The number of numerical operations is essentially independent of the time level at which the solution is desired.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The mechanical response of single cells and tissues exhibits a broad distribution of time scales that gives often rise to a distinctive power-law regime. Such complex behaviour cannot be easily captured by traditional rheological approaches, making material characterisation and predictive modelling very challenging. Here, we present a novel model combining conventional viscoelastic elements with fractional calculus that successfully captures the macroscopic relaxation response of epithelial monolayers. The parameters extracted from the fitting of the relaxation modulus allow prediction of the response of the same material to slow stretch and creep, indicating that the model captured intrinsic material properties. Two characteristic times can be derived from the model parameters, and together these explain different qualitative behaviours observed in creep after genetic and chemical treatments. We compared the response of tissues with the behaviour of single cells as well as intra-cellular and extra-cellular components, and linked the power-law behaviour of the epithelium to the dynamics of the cell cortex. Such a unified model for the mechanical response of biological materials provides a novel and robust mathematical approach for diagnostic methods based on mechanical traits as well as more accurate computational models of tissues mechanics.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  title = {The Subjective Judgement of the Elastic and Plastic Properties of Soft Bodies; the "Differential Thresholds" for Viscosities and Compression Moduli},
  volume = {128},
  abstract = {In measuring the softness of materials which show both elastic and plastic properties, it is customary either to assess the softness and elasticity by means of purely empirical tests, or, more frequently in industrial processes, to rely on the subjective judgment of some experienced person. Little is known of the capacity of individuals to measure such properties by tactual, kinaesthetic and visual observations, save that Katz (1937) has made a preliminary study of the capacity of bakers to judge the properties of flour dough, and concludes that their special skill is not in the main due to any abnormal capacity to judge flow and deformation (``rheological'') properties. Problems of this kind are to be found in many industries, notably bread and biscuit making, cheese and butter manufacture and ceramics. On the theoretical side, the data from such complex materials have been fitted into a double framework originally devised for true fluids and elastic solids respectively. Equations were used containing two terms, one an essentially Newtonian term, but involving a variable viscosity, and the other an essentially Hookian term suitably modified to allow for elastic hysteresis and after-effect. There is much to be said for this treatment. The properties so evaluated are obtained in c. g. s. Units, and are reproducible so long as fixed arbitrary conditions of stress and strain are maintained. Moreover, physicists are accustomed to thinking in terms of viscosities and elastic moduli, and more readily assimilate information presented in such familiar terms. On the other hand, it must be remembered that to divide the phenomena of deformation into viscous and elastic parts involves a division of the strains produced into recoverable and non-recoverable components; and, since some materials show exceedingly slow elastic after-effects, such a distinction is often quite arbitrary. Moreover, for very complex systems such as are met with in nature and dealt with in industry, the Newtonian-Hookian framework is decidedly artificial.},

Regardless of the pore size, ranging from 450 to 5500 nm in diameter, cells were able to span the pores. They did not crawl into the holes or grow around the pores. Generally, we found that cells cultured on non-porous surfaces are stiffer, i.e. cortical tension rises from 0.1 to 0.3 mN m-1, and less fluid than cells grown over pores. The mechanical data are corroborated by electron microscopy imaging showing more cytoskeletal filaments on flat samples in comparison to porous ones. By contrast, cellular compliance increases with pore size and cells display a more fluid-like behaviour on larger pores. Interestingly, cells on pores larger than 3500 nm produce thick actin bundles that bridge the pores and thereby strengthen the contact zone of the cells.},

The performance of the filter was tested by imaging 530 and 1590 nm steps. With compensation, the creep response was reduced to 2.6\%, compared to 9.6\% without compensation, for images taken over 6.67 minutes. Closed loop operation can offer better creep compensation but is a more expensive option. Moreover, it reduces image resolution for small scans/sample features due to limited dynamic range of sensors at high bandwidth.},

The spatial homogeneity and ergodicity of the material statistics justify homogenization in the vein of the Hill\textendash{}Mandel condition for viscoelastic media. Thus, uniform kinematic- or traction-controlled boundary conditions, applied to sufficiently large domains, provide macroscopic (RVE level) responses. With computational mechanics, this strategy is applied over the entire range of the relative content of both phases. Setting the volume fraction of either the elastic phase or the viscoelastic phase at the critical value ( 0.59) results in fractal patterns of site-percolation. Extensive simulations of boundary value problems show that, for a viscoelastic composite having such a fractal structure, the integer (not fractional) calculus model is adequate. In other words, the spatial randomness of the composite material\textemdash{}even in the fractal regime\textemdash{}is not necessarily the cause of the fractional order viscoelasticity.},

  abstract = {Pectin-based resistant, interactive and versatile hydrogel vehicles for oral administration have been prepared. These systems are thought to be versatile enough to allow the inclusion of substances (such as the surfactants tested: Pluronic, Tween, Na Lauryl sulphate) that may contribute to tailor the drug release patterns. Tolbutamide, that shows a discrete and pH-dependent solubility in water, has been employed as a model drug to test the capability of these matrices to overcome such drug-imposed restraints. The incorporation of different surfactants produced pectin-based hydrogels of difficult manipulation. In order to improve this drawback, two different strategies have been developed: blending with agarose or freeze-drying. The presence of agarose yields robust systems that can be handled and tested as prepared, in the fresh state. Freeze-drying not only allows to shape pure pectin and blend systems, but also generates a porous structure whose microstructure, determined by the different components included, influences on the drug release behavior. Tolbutamide release kinetics from freshly prepared matrices can be fitted to the Higuchi model while the freeze-dried ones adjust to the Korsmeyer\textendash{}Peppas model; hence the hydrogel chains rearrangement processes rule the release during the rehydration process.},

In all cases, the shear diagrams exhibited the typical pseudoplastic behaviour and were reconstructed by using the well-known Ostwdld-de Waele model, The effect of temperature on the consistency index (K) at constant alginate concentration was better described by using a power-law model rather than the Arrhenius relationship. The changes in the flow behaviour index (n) with T were statistically negligible (at the 95\% confidence level in about 80\% of all experiments) as compared to those in K, while those with y were described by using an empirical hyperbolic model. All the regression coefficients of this model were then correlated to the average molecular weight of each a\&ate studied, the latter being estimated on the basis of the corresponding intrinsic viscosity via a Mark-Houwink regression. By maximising the least squares regression coejjicient (r'j up to 0.99, it was possible to reconstruct the experimental apparent viscosities (uJ with a mean standard error of ca. 12\%, thus resulting in straightforward estimation of the thickening capability of any alginate whatever its weed origin based upon its average molecular weight only.

  abstract = {Four alginate gels were prepared by in situ release of calcium cations from Ca-EDTA with gradual hydrolysis of d-glucono-{$\delta$}-lactone (GDL) in 3wt\% of aqueous solutions of four alginate samples with different M/G compositions, molecular weights, and molecular weight distributions. The sol\textendash{}gel transition was monitored by measuring the dynamic mechanical spectroscopy in the linear region with variation in the mole ratio f of Ca2+ to the carboxyl group in the alginate. fgel, the critical value of f at the gel point, was determined according to the appearance of power law relaxation for the storage and loss moduli as proposed by Winter and Chambon. The critical exponent of relaxation moduli n for the power law was estimated from the loss tangent tan{$\delta$}=G{${''}$}/G{${'}$} at the gel point which is independent of angular frequency. fgel for the two samples with higher M/G ratio is about 0.037 while that for the other two samples with lower M/G ratio is 0.049 and 0.060, suggesting that more Ca2+ cations are chelated into the `egg-box' cavities formed by the G sequence to cross-link alginate chains with higher G content. The n value is higher than 0.5, showing that the Ca2+ induced alginate network is not perfect due to its low concentration.},

In the early 1950's, Soviet researchers pioneered the study of ginseng, which is considered to be the primary resistogen, and some other plants of the ``ginseng group''. A sizable volume of literature was published as a result of their studies. This article reports the results of Soviet research on the ginseng group for the past three decades, traces the progress of Soviet resistogen studies, and examines their current status. Because of its rarity, ginseng was found to be impractical as a source of raw material for the mass production of medicines. Consequently, Soviet scholars shifted the focus of their research from studying ginseng to other members of the ginseng group in order to find suitable substitutes. Four resistogenic plants were identified, studied and finally introduced into therapeutic practice, between 1955 and 1964. Eleutherococcus or eleuthero ginseng is considered to be the most important of these substitutes.},

  abstract = {Sodium alginate from Moroccan Laminaria digitata brown seaweed were extracted under different conditions. The extraction yield was affected by the extraction temperature and the samples' size. Alginates were purified by re-precipitation with ethanol and characterized by 1H NMR, fluorescence spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy, in order to determine their structural and physicochemical properties. Viscosimetric measurements gave an intrinsic viscosity of 2.542dL/g which permits to calculate the average molar mass value (1.14\texttimes{}105g/mol). By analyzing 1H NMR spectra, Moroccan L. digitata alginates showed a high quantity of both homopolymeric mannoronic and guluronic blocks (FMM=0.47) and (FGG=0.41) respectively, while the alternating block fractions (FMG=0.06 and FGM=0.06) showed low values than those previously described in the literature. The M/G ratio value is 1.12 allowing the preparation of alginates suitable to form soft and elastic gels more than brittle ones. The characteristics obtained for Moroccan Laminaria digitata may be useful to obtain polyelectrolyte complexes for the production of drug delivery micro- and nanoparticles. In some cases, a charged polysaccharide with low viscosity is needed.},

Introduced negatively charged demethylesterified blocks (DMB) were excised as oligomers with limited endo-polygalacturonase (EPG) digestion, and then separated and quantified by high performance anion exchange chromatography. Exhaustive EPG digestion was also performed and the concentrations of mono-, di- and tri-galacturonic acid (GalA) produced were estimated. The CpL-PME mode of action was modeled while the HG population's nanostructure and the resulting functionality of the modified pectin were characterized. The results indicated that average DMB size and number of these ``average'' blocks per molecule increased as the overall degree of methylesterification (DM) decreased by CpL-PME treatment (P~{$<~$}0.05). Average DMB size differed depending on the reaction pH at each DM. Absolute degree of blockiness (DBabs) increased as DM decreased and demonstrated a linear relationship with the DM at both reaction pH values. Significant positive correlations between DBabs and average DMB size were observed for both pH series (P~{$<~$}0.05). The enzyme mode of action, modeled in silico, demonstrates a processive multiple attack mechanism. Functionally, the storage modulus of ionotropic gels formed from the processed substrates increased as DM decreased, and as DBabs and average DMB size increased with highly significant correlations (P~{$<~$}0.001). These results indicate it is feasible to engineer pectin nanostructure and functionality with CpL-PME.},

The fast method has \$O(n\_0+\textbackslash{}sum\_\{\textbackslash{}ell\}\^L\{q\}\_\{\textbackslash{}alpha\}(N\_\{\textbackslash{}ell\}))\$ active memory and \$O(n\_0n\_T+ (n\_T-n\_0)\textbackslash{}sum\_\{\textbackslash{}ell\}\^L\{q\}\_\{\textbackslash{}alpha\}(N\_\{\textbackslash{}ell\}))\$ operations, where \$L=\textbackslash{}log(n\_T-n\_0)\$, \$n\_0=\{\textbackslash{}Delta T\}/\textbackslash{}tau,n\_T=T/\textbackslash{}tau\$, \$\textbackslash{}tau\$ is the stepsize, \$T\$ is the final time, and \$\{q\}\_\{\textbackslash{}alpha\}\{(N\_\{\textbackslash{}ell\})\}\$ is the number of quadrature points used in the truncated Laguerre--Gauss (LG) quadrature. The error bound of the present fast method is analyzed. It is shown that the error from the truncated LG quadrature is independent of the stepsize, and can be made arbitrarily small by choosing suitable parameters that are given explicitly. Numerical examples are presented to verify the effectiveness of the current fast method.},

  abstract = {In the paper, we present a high order fast algorithm with almost optimum memory for the Caputo fractional derivative, which can be expressed as a convolution of u{${'}$}(t) with the kernel (tn - t)-{$\alpha$}. In the fast algorithm, the interval [0, tn-1] is split into nonuniform subintervals. The number of the subintervals is in the order of log n at the n-th time step. The fractional kernel function is approximated by a polynomial function of K-th degree with a uniform absolute error on each subinterval. We save K + 1 integrals on each subinterval, which can be written as a convolution of u{${'}$}(t) with a polynomial base function. As compared with the direct method, the proposed fast algorithm reduces the storage requirement and computational cost from O(n) to O((K + 1) log n) at the n-th time step. We prove that the convergence rate of the fast algorithm is the same as the direct method even a high order direct method is considered. The convergence rate and efficiency of the fast algorithm are illustrated via several numerical examples.},

We determine the frequency-dependent shear modulus of cultured mammalian cells by using four different methods, both unique and well established. This approach clarifies the effects of cytoskeletal heterogeneity, ATP-dependent processes, and cell regional variations on the interpretation of such measurements. Our results clearly indicate two qualitatively similar, but distinct, mechanical responses, corresponding to the cortical and intracellular networks, each having an unusual, weak power-law form at low frequency. The two frequency-dependent responses we observe are remarkably similar to those reported for a variety of cultured mammalian cells measured with different techniques, suggesting it is a useful consensus description. Finally, we discuss possible physical explanations for the observed mechanical response.},

  shorttitle = {Beyond Fractional Derivatives},
  abstract = {Dynamic systems involving convolution integrals with decaying kernels, of which fractionally damped systems form a special case, are non-local in time and hence infinite dimensional. Straightforward numerical solution of such systems up to time~t needs  computations owing to the repeated evaluation of integrals over intervals that grow like~t. Finite-dimensional and local approximations are thus desirable. We~present here an approximation method which first rewrites the evolution equation as a coupled infinite-dimensional system with no convolution, and then uses Galerkin approximation with finite elements to obtain linear, finite-dimensional, constant coefficient approximations for the convolution. This paper is a broad generalization, based on a new insight, of our prior work with fractional order derivatives (Singh~\& Chatterjee 2006Nonlinear Dyn.45, 183\textendash{}206). In particular, the decaying kernels we can address are now generalized to the Laplace transforms of known functions; of these, the power law kernel of fractional order differentiation is a special case. The approximation can be refined easily. The local nature of the approximation allows numerical solution up to time t with  computations. Examples with several different kernels show excellent performance. A key feature of our approach is that the dynamic system in which the convolution integral appears is itself approximated using another system, as distinct from numerically approximating just the solution for the given initial values; this allows non-standard uses of the approximation, e.g. in stability analyses.},

Candidate sets of functions are proposed for the elastic and viscoelastic material functions present in the model, including two functions whose origins lie in the fractional calculus.

  abstract = {Fractional calculus and fractional differential equations are popular in describing anomalous diffusion, ground water flow and transport, and the price fluctuation in finance, etc. Some numerical methods are developed to solve the fractional ordinary differential equations. However, for most of these methods it seems that we always have to make a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy because of the non-local properties of fractional operators. In other words, for ensuring the accuracy, usually the computation cost is hard to accept; on the other hand if the computation cost is reduced then the accuracy is greatly lost. Based on the idea of equidistributing meshes, this paper designs efficient numerical schemes, which have linearly increasing computation cost with time t but not losing the accuracy at the same time. Error estimates for the proposed schemes are performed; and the numerical examples demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms.},

  abstract = {Accurate mechanical property data obtained at large shear deformations and high frequencies are a fundamental component of realistie numerical simulations of soft tissue injury. Although many commercial systems exist for testing shear properties of viscoelastic materials with properties similar to soft biological tissue, none are capable of determining properties at high loading rates necessary for modeling soft tissue injury. Previous custom shear testing systems, though capable of high-frequency loading, indirectly measure tissue properties by using analytical corrections for inertial effects. To address these limitations, a new custom designed oscillatory shear testing apparatus (STA) capable of testing soft biological tissues in simple shear has been constructed and validated. Through a proper selection of sample thickness, direct measurement of material properties at high frequencies is achieved mechanically without analytical inertial adjustments. The complex shear modulus of three mixtures of silicone gel with viscoelastic properties in a range similar to soft biological tissue was characterized in the STA over a dynamic frequency range of 20\textendash{}200 Hz and validated with a commercially available solids rheometer. The frequency-dependent complex shear modulus measurements of the STA were within 10\% of the rheometer measurements for all mixtures over the entire frequency range tested. The STA represents substantive improvement over current shear testing methods by providing direct measurement of the shear behavior of soft viscoclastic materials at high frequencies. Mechanical property data gained from this device will provide a more realistic basis for numerical simulations of biological structures.},

Quantifying these forces remains a major challenge in bioengineering; yet such measurements are essential for the understanding of cellular function. Traction force microscopy is one of the most successful and broadly-used force probing technologies, chosen for the simplicity of its implementation, flexibility to mimic cellular conditions, and well-established analysis pipe-line. Here, we review the accomplishments, and discuss the applicability and limitations of traction force microscopy. We explain fundamental shortcomings of the method, summarise latest improvements, and outline future pathways towards the impact of the method, especially considering latest developments in state-of-the-art super-resolution fluorescence imaging. In light of the increasing discovery of the importance of mechanobiology in cell physiology, we envisage traction force microscopy to remain a major player for quantifying mechanical forces in living cells.},

Much of the paper is dedicated to explaining how reddit functions, describing the behaviour of the subreddit communities in question and then asking whether these demonstrated collective intelligence. Subreddit communities submit and vote on content, through their votes they make collective decisions about which content will be broadcast to their community. Large subreddit communities that formed rapidly to support a candidate in an election have not previously been observed on reddit\textemdash{}these offered an interesting context for the consideration of whether subreddit communities demonstrate collective intelligence. Voting is a key determinant of what happens on each subreddit and it is conducted anonymously, it is, therefore, not possible to understand the role(s) that every individual plays in the functioning of the subreddit. The behaviour of these subreddit communities can only be understood as a collective of submitting, commenting, voting and moderating participants. Whether these collectives behave intelligently is a matter of how one defines intelligence\textemdash{}but it is clear that they can be effective in pursuing certain ends. These collectives encounter and sometimes oppose each other on reddit. The community of Trump supporters in particular were in conflict with a number of other highprofile communities on the site, and also the platform's administrators.},

  abstract = {Nanomanipulation with Atomic Force Microscopes (AFMs) for nanoparticles with overall sizes on the order of 10 nm has been hampered in the past by the large spatial uncertainties encountered in tip positioning. This paper addresses the compensation of nonlinear effects of creep and hysteresis on the piezo scanners which drive most AFMs. Creep and hysteresis are modeled as the superposition of fundamental operators, and their inverse model is obtained by using the inversion properties of the Prandtl-Ishlinskii operator. Identification of the parameters in the forward model is achieved by a novel method that uses the topography of the sample and does not require position sensors. The identified parameters are used to compute the inverse model, which in turn serves to drive the AFM in an open-loop, feedforward scheme. Experimental results show that this approach effectively reduces the spatial uncertainties associated with creep and hysteresis, and supports automated, computer-controlled manipulation operations that otherwise would fail.},

  abstract = {Viscoelastic behavior reflects the combined viscous and elastic responses, under mechanical stress, of materials which are intermediate between liquids and solids in character. Polymers\textemdash{}the basic materials of the rubber and plastic industries and important to the textile, petroleum, automobile, paper, and pharmaceutical industries as well\textemdash{}exhibit viscoelasticity to a pronounced degree. Their viscoelastic properties determine the mechanical performance of the final products of these industries, and also the success of processing methods at intermediate stages of production. Viscoelastic Properties of Polymers examines, in detail, the effects of the many variables on which the basic viscoelastic properties depend. These include temperature, pressure, and time; polymer chemical composition, molecular weight and weight distribution, branching and crystallinity; dilution with solvents or plasticizers; and mixture with other materials to form composite systems. With guidance by molecular theory, the dependence of viscoelastic properties on these variables can be simplified by introducing certain ancillary concepts such as the fractional free volume, the monomeric friction coefficient, and the spacing between entanglement loci, to provide a qualitative understanding and in many cases a quantitative prediction of how to achieve desired results. The phenomenological theory of viscoelasticity\textemdash{}which permits interrelation of the results of different types of experiments\textemdash{}is presented first, with many useful approximation procedures for calculations given. A wide variety of experimental methods is then described, with critical evaluation of their applicability to polymeric materials of different consistencies and in different regions of the time scale (or, for oscillating deformations, the frequency scale). A review of the present state of molecular theory follows, so that viscoelasticity can be related to the motions of flexible polymer molecules and their entanglements and network junctions. The dependence of viscoelastic properties on temperature and pressure, and its descriptions using reduced variables, are discussed in detail. Several chapters are then devoted to the dependence of viscoelastic properties on chemical composition, molecular weight, presence of diluents, and other features, for several characteristic classes of polymer materials. Finally, a few examples are given to illustrate the many potential applications of these principles to practical problems in the processing and use of rubbers, plastics, and fibers, and in the control of vibration and noise. The third edition has been brought up to date to reflect the important developments, in a decade of exceptionally active research, which have led to a wider use of polymers, and a wider recognition of the importance and range of application of viscoelastic properties. Additional data have been incorporated, and the book's chapters on dilute solutions, theory of undiluted polymers, plateau and terminal zones, cross-linked polymers, and concentrated solutions have been extensively rewritten to take into account new theories and new experimental results. Technical managers and research workers in the wide range of industries in which polymers play an important role will find that the book provides basic information for practical applications, and graduate students in chemistry and engineering will find, in its illustrations with real data and real numbers, an accessible introduction to the principles of viscoelasticity.},

To reach a better understanding of the mechanics and dynamics of the cortex, we study here HeLa cells in mitosis as a simple model system. In our~assay, single rounded cells are dynamically compressed between two parallel plates. Our measurements indicate that the cortical layer is the dominant mechanical element in mitosis as opposed to the cytoplasmic interior. To characterize the time-dependent rheological response, we extract a complex elastic modulus that characterizes the resistance of the cortex against area dilation. In this way, we present a rheological characterization of the cortical actomyosin network in the linear regime. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of actin cross linkers and the impact of active prestress on rheological behavior. Notably, we find that cell mechanics values in mitosis are captured by a simple rheological model characterized by a single timescale on the order of 10 s, which marks the onset of fluidity in the system.},

  abstract = {Cell wall modifying capacity and enzyme composition of rapid and slow-softening tropical fruits during ripening were investigated with respect to that of tomato, noted to contain significant endo-polygalacturonases (endo-PG; EC 3.2.1.15) activities. Besides PG, other enzymes selected to represent their pectin and/or hemicellulose modifying potentials were pectin methylesterase (EC 3.2.1.11), {$\beta$}-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23), and (1\textrightarrow4)-{$\beta$}-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.4). Time for 50\% firmness loss was about 1.5 days for Beaumont guava (Psidium guajava L.), 3 days for tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.), Mas banana (Musa acuminata, AA group) and Eksotika papaya (Carica papaya L.), 4.5 days for Harumanis mango (Mangifera indica L.), and 20 and 24 days for B10 carambola (Averrhoa carambola L.) and Kampuchea guava, respectively. Capacity to markedly modify cell walls as reflected by capability to impact increased pectin solubility and depolymerization of chelator-soluble pectin, and which varied markedly with the fruit types, may not necessarily be correlated with softening rate, neither was it dependent on the presence of any significant endo-PG activities. Extensive pectin modifications occurred in ripening tomato, mango and papaya. Beaumont guava and Mas banana, though softened rapidly, experienced much limited pectin degradation, seemingly unable to match the modifications that occur in the slow-softening carambola and Kampuchea guava. All fruits tested, except tomato, contained significant exo-PG (EC 3.2.1.67) activities, thus explaining that endo-PG might not be the determining factor of differential softening. All other enzymes, viz. pectin methylesterase, (1\textrightarrow4)-{$\beta$}-glucanase, and in particular, {$\beta$}-galactosidase seemed relevant and might contribute significantly to the observed variations in softening rate amongst the fruits.},

We explore the current and potential utilization of electronic-nose devices (with specialized sensor arrays), instruments that are very effective in discriminating complex mixtures of fruit volatiles, as new effective tools for more efficient fruit aroma analyses to replace conventional expensive methods used in fruit aroma assessments. We review the chemical nature of fruit volatiles during all stages of the agro-fruit production process, describe some of the more important applications that electronic nose (e-nose) technologies have provided for fruit aroma characterizations, and summarize recent research providing e-nose data on the effectiveness of these specialized gas-sensing instruments for fruit identifications, cultivar discriminations, ripeness assessments and fruit grading for assuring fruit quality in commercial markets.},

Hence, the resonant claim that was broadcast primarily to white audiences in each place `to take our country back'. The politics of both campaigns was also echoed in those social scientific analyses that sought to focus on the `legitimate' claims of the `left behind' or those who had come to see themselves as `strangers in their own land'. The skewing of white majority political action as the action of a more narrowly defined white working class served to legitimize analyses that might otherwise have been regarded as racist. In effect, I argue that a pervasive `methodological whiteness' has distorted social scientific accounts of both Brexit and Trump's election victory and that this needs to be taken account of in our discussion of both phenomena.},

  volume = {143},
  issn = {0378-8741},
  abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Harpagophytum procumbens subps. procumbens (Burch.) DC. ex Meisn. (Pedaliaceae) is an important traditional medicine growing in the Kalahari region of southern Africa where it is consumed as a general health tonic and for treating diverse ailments including arthritis, pain, fever, ulcers and boils.
Aim of the review
To provide a comprehensive overview of the ethnobotany, phytochemistry and biological activity of H. procumbens and possibly make recommendations for further research.
Materials and methods
Peer-reviewed articles on H. procumbens were acquired on Scopus, ScienceDirect and SciFinder, there was no specific timeline set for the search. A focus group discussion was held with different communities in Botswana to further understand ethnobotanical uses of the plant.
Results
Harpogophytum procumbens is used for a wide variety of health conditions in the form of infusions, decoctions, tinctures, powders and extracts. In addition to the common local use for arthritis and pain, other ethnomedicinal uses include dyspepsia, fever, blood diseases, urinary tract infections, postpartum pain, sprains, sores, ulcers and boils. Scientific studies revealed that H. procumbens exhibits analgesic, anti-oxidant, anti-diabetic, anti-epileptic, antimicrobial and antimalarial activities amongst others. Iridoid glycosides and phenylpropanoid glycosides have been the focus of phytochemical investigations as the biological activity has been ascribed to the iridoid glycosides (such as harpagoside and harpagide), which are common in nature and are known to possess anti-inflammatory activity. In addition, it has been shown that the hydrolysed products of harpagoside and harpagide have more pronounced anti-inflammatory activity when compared to the unhydrolysed compounds. Harpagophytum zeyheri is a close taxonomic ally of H. procumbens but H. procumbens is the favoured species of commerce, and contains higher levels of the pharmacologically active constituents. The two are used interchangeably and H. procumbens raw material is often intentionally adulterated with H. zeyheri and this may impact on the efficacy of inadequately controlled health products. The main exporter of this highly commercialised plant is Namibia. In 2009 alone, Harpagophytum exports were worth approximately \texteuro{}1.06 million. The high demand for health products based on this plant has led to over-harvesting, raising concerns about sustainability. Although only the secondary tubers are utilised commercially, the whole plant is often destroyed during harvesting.
Conclusions
Harpagophytum procumbens is used to treat a wide range of ailments. Some of the ethnobotanical claims have been confirmed through in vitro studies, however, when the constituents deemed to be the biologically active compounds were isolated the efficacy was lower than that of the whole extract. This necessitates the use of a different approach where all the metabolites are considered using a robust method such as spectroscopy; the phytochemical data can then be superimposed on the biological activity. Furthermore, there is a need to develop rapid and efficient quality control methods for both raw materials and products because the orthodox methods in current use are time-consuming and labour intensive.},

  abstract = {Harpagophytum procumbens DC [family: Pedaliaceae] is widely used in South African traditional medicine for the treatment, management and/or control of a variety of human ailments. In the present study, we have examined the anticonvulsant activity of Harpagophytum procumbens secondary root aqueous extract (HPE, 50\textendash{}800mg/kg i.p.) against pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-, picrotoxin (PCT)- and bicuculline (BCL)-induced seizures in mice. Phenobarbitone and diazepam were used as reference anticonvulsant drugs for comparison. Like the reference anticonvulsant agents used, H. procumbens secondary root aqueous extract (HPE, 100\textendash{}800mg/kg i.p.) significantly (P{$<$}0.05\textendash{}0.001) delayed the onset of, and antagonized, pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures. The plant's extract (HPE, 100\textendash{}800mg/kg i.p.) also profoundly antagonized picrotoxin (PCT)-induced seizures, but only partially and weakly antagonized bicuculline (BCL)-induced seizures. Although the data obtained in the present study do not provide conclusive evidence, it would appear that H. procumbens secondary root aqueous extract (HPE) produces its anticonvulsant activity by enhancing GABAergic neurotransmission and/or facilitating GABAergic action in the brain. In general, the average onset of convulsion was delayed, while the average duration of convulsion was markedly reduced. The plant's extract also depressed the central nervous system (CNS). It is, therefore, thought that the anticonvulsant property of the herb may be linked, at least in part, to its ability to depress the central nervous system. However, the results of this experimental animal study indicate that H. procumbens secondary root aqueous extract possesses anticonvulsant activity, and thus lend pharmacological support to the suggested folkloric, ethnomedical uses of the plant's extract in the treatment, management and/or control of epilepsy and childhood convulsions in some rural communities of South Africa.},

In a double-blind, randomized, multicentre clinical study, the efficacy and tolerance of a herbal medicine product, Harpadol\textregistered{} (6 capsules/day, each containing 435 mg of powdered cryoground powder Harpagophytum procumbens), was compared with diacerhein 100 mg/day in the treatment, for 4 months, of 122 patients suffering from osteoarthritis of the knee and hip. Assessments of pain and functional disability were made on a 10 cm horizontal visual analogue scale; severity of osteoarthritis was evaluated by Lequesne's index. Spontaneous pain showed a significant improvement during the course of the study and there was no difference in the efficacy of the two treatments. Similarly, there was a progressive and significant reduction in the Lequesne functional index and no statistical difference was found between Harpadol\textregistered{} and diacerhein. At completion of the study, patients taking Harpadol\textregistered{} were using significantly less NSAIDs and antalgic drugs. The frequency of adverse events was significantly lower in the Harpadol\textregistered{} group. The most frequent event reported was diarrhea, occurring in 8.1 \% and 26.7 \% of Harpadol\textregistered{} and diacerhein patients respectively. The global tolerance assessment by patients at the end of treatment favoured Harpadol\textregistered. The results of this study demonstrate that Harpadol\textregistered{} is comparable in efficacy and superior in safety to diacerhein.},

  volume = {3},
  issn = {0944-7113},
  abstract = {Summary
In a study that indicates more definitive investigation is needed, 118 patients with chronic back problems seeking treatment for acute attacks of pain were included in a 4-week randomised double-blinded study on the safety and effectiveness of an extract of Harpagophytum procumbens. Both, the treatment and the placebo were administered in the form of two tablets taken three times per day; the treatment group had a daily consumption equal to 6,000 mg of crude preparation (50 mg harpagoside, the putative active ingredient). The treatment and placebo groups were well matched in physical characteristics; in the severity, duration, nature and accompaniments of their pain; and in laboratory indices of organ system function. 109 patients completed the study. The study was originally designed to measure Harpagophytum's effectiveness by measuring the use of supplementary pain-killer Tramadol over its final 3 weeks. However, this did not differ between the Harpagophytum and placebo groups nor was the consumption closely related to the amount of pain. Further analysis, though, revealed that 9 out of 51 patients who received the extract were pain free at the end of treatment compared to only 1 out of 54 patients who received placebo. A modification of the Arhus index was used as an additional measure, covering the more global impact. The percentage change was greater in those patients who received Harpagophytum extract than in those who received placebo, but inferential testing (Mann Whitney) allowed only 94\% degree of confidence that this had not arisen by chance. The Arhus index reduction was based on improvement in pain. This indication of effectiveness, and the absence of demonstrable adverse effects show that more definite clinical studies of Harpagophytum extract will be worthwhile.},

In spontaneously beating Langendorff preparations of rabbit heart, the Harpagophytum procumbens methanolic extract caused a mild decrease in the heart rate with a concomitant mild positive inotropic effect at lower doses but a marked negative inotropic effect at higher doses. The coronary flow decreased at higher doses only. The negative chronotropic and positive inotropic effects of harpagoside were comparatively higher with respect to that of the extract, whereas harpagide had only a slight negative chronotropic effect and a considerable negative inotropic one.

The book is comprised of 31 protocols in all and provides critical information regarding the cultivation and preservation of seaweeds, their chemical composition, as well as their cellular and molecular characterization. This type of research is critical and timely, as the last few decades have witnessed remarkable advancements in phycological research worldwide. Consideration of algal resources for food, fuel, chemicals, feed, and fertilizer has furthered the development of diverse laboratory techniques that not only advance their utilization substantially, but also provided new insights in understanding the molecular basis of their form and function. This recent progress has enabled researchers to determine and quantify various metabolites and organic macromolecules such as carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids.   Protocols for Macroalgae Research thus uses macroalgae as a model organism for addressing fundamental research problems. No recent comprehensive literature of this format exists on this topic. As such, this state-of-the-art protocol text both develops and standardizes the various macroalgae approaches located within the field. It does so by featuring a wide-range of protocols from invited experts; each protocol features a brief introductory overview, an inventory of materials and reagents, and step-by-step experimental procedures, which include helpful notes offering care and cautions. This protocol book is an invaluable reference for beginning and preexisting researchers within the field of macroalgae.},

However, the relationship between its chemistry and mechanical properties is not fully understood, especially \emph{in vivo}. In this study, a protocol for viscoelastic micro-indentation using atomic force microscopy (AFM) was developed and applied to pectin \emph{in vitro} and \emph{in vivo}. After determining that linear viscoelasticity was a suitable theoretical framework for \emph{in vitro} pectin analyses were conducted with both a standard linear solid and fractional Zener model. These indicated a strong coupling between elastic and viscous properties over a range of degrees of methyl-esterification (DM). Both elasticity and viscosity were found to vary non-linearly with DM which had interesting consequences for pectin gels of mixed DM. In \emph{Arabidopsis} cell walls, the standard linear solid model was found to be appropriate. In this \emph{in vivo} composite material a weaker elastic-viscous coupling was exhibited, correlated with DM. The viscoelastic testing \emph{in vivo} of rapidly elongating cell walls, rich in high DM pectin, displayed a longer viscous time-scale. The implications of the testing method and results are discussed in the context of mechanobiology, mechano-chemistry, and cell growth.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Aeroponics is the process of growing plants in an air/mist environment without the use of soil or an aggregate media. Aeroponics has contributed to advances in several areas of study including root morphology, nutrient uptake, drought and flood stress, and responses to variations in oxygen and/or carbon dioxide root zone concentrations. The adaptability of the aeroponic process that has benefited researchers makes its application to spaceflight plant growth systems appealing. Greater control of growth parameters permits a greater range of crop performance throttling and the elimination of aggregates or common growth substrates lowers system mass, lessens disease propagation between plants, and can decrease the required crew time for both planting and harvesting. However, because of the use of less reliable types of aeroponic techniques and concerns with open two-phase fluids within the root zone in microgravity, many advanced life support technology researchers opted for nutrient delivery concepts that offered more fluid control, containment and simpler subsystem designs. The resulting systems have been successful for on-orbit plant growth, but have yet to achieve high performance crop production equal to terrestrial standards. Re-examining historical concerns, along with an overview of recent work demonstrating hypogravity aeroponics, shows the promise that aeroponics still holds for spaceflight crop production.},

  issn = {0959-6526},
  abstract = {Life cycle assessments of bio-based polymer resin and products historically have shown favorable results in terms of environmental impacts and energy use compared to petroleum-based products. However, calculation of these impacts always depends on the system and boundary conditions considered during the study. This paper reports a cradle-to-cradle Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) in comparison with poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and poly(styrene) (PS) thermoformed clamshell containers, used for packaging of strawberries with emphasis on different end-of-life scenarios. It considers all the inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides and seed corn required for the growing and harvesting of corn used for manufacturing PLA. For PET and PS, the extraction of crude oil and the entire cracking processes from crude oil through styrene and ethylene glycol and terephathalic acid are considered. Global warming, aquatic acidification, aquatic eutrophication, aquatic ecotoxicity, ozone depletion, non-renewable energy and respiratory organics, land occupation and respiratory inorganics were the selected midpoint impact categories. The geographical scope of the study reflects data from Europe, North America and the Middle East. PET showed the highest overall values for all the impact categories, mainly due to the higher weight of the containers. The main impacts to the environment were the resin production and the transportation stage of the resins and containers. This implies that the transportation stage of the package is an important contributor to the environmental impact of the packaging systems, and that it cannot be diminished.},

This increase represents a 16\% correction, which is large enough to explain the persistent overestimation of growth rates of historical atmospheric CO2 by Earth system models. Without this correction, the CFE for global GPP is underestimated by 0.05 PgC/y/ppm. This finding implies that the contemporary terrestrial biosphere is more CO2 limited than previously thought.},

  abstract = {Background
Fluoxetine (FLX), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is prescribed for the treatment of major depressive disorder in young populations. Here, we explore the short- and long-term consequences of adolescent exposure to FLX on behavioral reactivity to emotion-eliciting stimuli.
Methods
Adolescent male rats received FLX (10 mg/kg) twice daily for 15 consecutive days (postnatal days 35\textendash{}49). The influence of FLX on behavioral reactivity to rewarding and aversive stimuli was assessed 24 hours (short-term) or 3 weeks after FLX treatment (long-term). A separate group of adult rats was also treated with FLX (postnatal days 65\textendash{}79) and responsiveness to forced swimming was assessed at identical time intervals as with the adolescents.
Results
Fluoxetine exposure during adolescence resulted in long-lasting decreases in behavioral reactivity to forced swimming stress and enhanced sensitivity to sucrose and to anxiety-eliciting situations in adulthood. The FLX-induced anxiety-like behavior was alleviated by re-exposure to FLX in adulthood. Fluoxetine treatment during adolescence also impaired sexual copulatory behaviors in adulthood. Fluoxetine-treated adult rats did not show changes in behavioral reactivity to forced swim stress as observed in those treated during adolescence and tested in adulthood.
Conclusions
Treating adolescent rats with FLX results in long-lived complex outputs regulated by the emotional valence of the stimulus, the environment in which it is experienced, and the brain circuitry likely being engaged by it. Our findings highlight the need for further research to improve our understanding of the alterations that psychotropic exposure may induce on the developing nervous system and the potential enduring effects resulting from such treatments.},

After a washout period their behavior in the elevated plus-maze, prepulse inhibition test, Forced swimming test and elevated T-maze were studied. In addition, the effects of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT on sexual behavior and lower lip retraction were measured. Paroxetine mildly inhibited weight gain during treatment. Both SSRIs caused a reduction in ejaculation frequency and in time spent on the open arm of the elevated plus-maze in adult rats. Fluvoxamine slightly increased avoidance latency in the elevated T-maze compared to paroxetine. No differences between the groups were found in the other tests.

Plant morphogenesis results from the turgor-induced yielding of the extracellular and load-bearing cell wall. Its mechanochemical equilibrium appears as a fundamental link between molecular growth regulation and the effective shape evolution of the tissue. We focus here on force-driven polymerization of the cell wall as a central process in growth control. We propose that mechanical forces facilitate the insertion of wall components, in particular pectins, a process that can be modulated through genetic regulation. We formalize this idea in a mathematical model, which we subsequently test with published experimental results.},

  abstract = {The effect of geometry on cell stiffness measured with micro-indentation techniques has been explored in single cells, however it is unclear if results on single cells can be readily transferred to indentation experiments performed on a tissue in vivo. Here we explored this question by using simulation models of osmotic treatments and micro-indentation experiments on 3D multicellular tissues with the finite element method. We found that the cellular context does affect measured cell stiffness, and that several cells of context in each direction are required for optimal results. We applied the model to micro-indentation data obtained with cellular force microscopy on the sepal of A. thaliana, and found that differences in measured stiffness could be explained by cellular geometry, and do not necessarily indicate differences in cell wall material properties or turgor pressure.},

The shoot and root growth, root characteristics, and mineral content of two lettuce cultivars were measured in aeroponics, and compared with hydroponics and substrate culture. The results showed that aeroponics remarkably improved root growth with a significantly greater root biomass, root/shoot ratio, and greater total root length, root area, and root volume. However, the greater root growth did not lead to greater shoot growth compared with hydroponics, due to the limited availability of nutrients and water. It was concluded that aeroponics systems may be better for high value true root crop production. Further research is necessary to determine the suitable pressure, droplet size, and misting interval in order to improve the continuous availability of nutrients and water in aeroponics, if it is to be used to grow crops such as lettuce for harvesting above-ground parts.},

Showers on one wing of a hospital were supplied with u.v.-irradiated water. Showers on another wing and 20 other outlets served as controls. Cultures prior to the installation of u.v. units showed all outlets to be heavily colonized with L. pneumophila. Despite disinfection of incoming water by u.v., Legionella in established niches of the plumbing system continued to survive. Superheat/flush and chlorination was then applied prior to u.v. activation. Although cultures became negative initially, recolonization occurred after I month. Scale accumulation on u.v. lamps had compromised the efficacy of u.v. irradiation. Filters were added to prevent scale accumulation on the u.v. lamps and the u.v.-supplied showers remained Legionella-free. U.V. plus prefiltration can prevent Legionella recolonization for at least 4 months after disinfection if the u.v. units are installed near the ``point-of-use''. Disinfection must be directed not only at incoming water, but also at established niches within the existing plumbing system. The advantages of u.v. include easy installation, low expense, and no adverse effects on water or plumbing.},

Irrigation system efficiency could be negatively affected by some natural flora such as micro (Arthrospira maxima) and macro (Cladophora sp.) algae. In this study, efficiency of UV-C radiation, which has been proven effectiveness in demolishing of bacteria and microbes in medicine, for micro and macro algae. Our study was performed under laboratory conditions and was carried out in two main phases. In the first phase, spectral absorbance curves were established for micro and macro algae, the greatest absorbance value was determined in UV region (300 nm to 450 nm). In the second phase, to analyze the growth of algae species depending on UV-C illumination, micro algae within three different basins with the same cross-sectional area and different water depths (D1:12.5 cm, D2:25 cm, D3:45cm) were exposed to UV-C radiation for different durations (2, 4, 6, 8 and 16 s). The maximum inhibition on the growth rate of A. maxima was observed in 16 s UV-C radiation treatment groups of D1 and D2 basins. Since Cladophora sp. macro algae are aquatic weeds floating over the water surface, they were exposed to UV-C radiation similar to micro algae only in D1 basin. The greatest reduction rate in biomass values of Cladophora sp. was observed in 16 s UV-C exposed groups. The experimental findings showed that UV-C radiation could be used to reduce growth of micro and macro algae. It was concluded based on present findings that UV-C radiation could reliably be used for efficient water use in open or closed irrigation systems.},

  volume = {31},

  abstract = {This article provides an overview of existing literature on the ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation effects on algae and cyanobacteria. We report on the effects of UV-B radiation to the growth and development, biomass, sensitivity, photosynthetic pigments, UV-B absorbing compounds, photosynthesis, protein and DNA damage, enzyme activity, nitrogen fixation and assimilation of nitrogen, protective mechanisms of algae and cyanobacteria, the accommodation of algae and cyanobacteria to environmental stress, and the effects to ecology system. Many of the studies show the dramatic effects of UV-B radiation; but typically these studies were conducted under conditions with supplemental UV-B irradiance that was higher than would ever occur outside experimental conditions or natural condition. A few of the studies reviewed used experimental conditions and supplemental UV-B irradiance that approached realism. Enhanced UV-B generally decreased chlorophyll content, whereas it increased UV-B absorbing compounds in many algae. Decrease in photosynthesis, particularly at higher UV-B doses, was due to both direct (effect on photosystem) and indirect (decrease in pigments) effects. The decreases in chlorophyll pigments and photosynthesis resulted in lower biomass. However, algae and cyanobacteria have evolved various avoidance and repair mechanisms to protect themselves against the damaging effects of UV radiation to acclimate to enhanced UV-B radiation. The review points to areas where further studies on the relationships among nitrogenase, Rubisco, antioxidase activity, signal, antioxidants, and free radicals under enhanced UV-B are needed to quantify the effects of UV-B radiation on algae and cyanobacteria. These studies are needed in order to develop dose response functions that can facilitate development of dynamic simulation models for use in UV-B and other environmental impact assessments.},

This generalization is increasingly important the more you work with linear PDEs, as we do in 18.303. For example, Green's functions are extremely cumbersome if one does not allow delta functions. Moreover, solving PDEs with functions that are not classically differentiable is of great practical importance (e.g. a plucked string with a triangle shape is not twice differentiable, making the wave equation problematic with traditional functions). Any serious work with PDEs will eventually run into the concept of a ``weak solution,'' which is essentially a version of the distribution concept.},

  abstract = {The treatment of major depression (MD) is still a major unmet medical need in the majority of patients. Sixty percent of cases of MD are treatment-resistant depression (TRD), showing that classical treatments for MD are poorly effective to non-effective. Magnesium has been largely removed from processed foods, especially refined grains, in the Western world, harming the brain and causing mood disorders. Magnesium deficiency causes N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) coupled calcium channels to be biased towards opening which causes neuronal injury and neurological dysfunction, which we believe results in MD. Oral administration of Mg to animals produced antidepressant-like effects that were comparable to those of antidepressant drugs. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) Mg has been found to be low in suicidal TRD. The first report of Mg treatment for agitated depression was published in 1921 showing success in 220 out of 250 cases. One 2008 randomized clinical trial showed that Mg was as effective as the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine in treating MD. Intravenous and oral Mg protocols have been reported to rapidly terminate MD safely and without side effects. Brain Mg deficiency reduces serotonin levels, and antidepressant drugs have been shown to have the action of raising brain Mg. Excessive calcium, glutamate and aspartate intake can greatly worsen MD. We believe that, when taken together, there is more than sufficient evidence to implicate inadequate dietary Mg as contributing to the cause of MD, and we suggest that physicians prescribe Mg for its prevention and treatment.},

  title = {Correlations to Predict Droplet Size in Ultrasonic Atomisation},
  volume = {39},
  issn = {0041-624X},
  abstract = {In conventional two fluid nozzles, the high velocity air imparts its energy to the liquid and disrupts the liquid sheet into droplets. If the energy for liquid sheet fragmentation can be supplied by the use of ultrasonic energy, finer droplets with high sphericity and uniform size distribution can be achieved. The other advantage of ultrasound induced atomisation process is the lower momentum associated with ejected droplets compared to the momentum carried by the droplets formed using conventional nozzles. This has advantage in coating and granulation processes. An ultrasonic probe sonicator was designed with a facility for liquid feed arrangement and was used to atomise the liquid into droplets. An ingenious method of droplet measurement was attempted by capturing the droplets on a filter paper (size variation with regard to wicking was uniform in all cases) and these are subjected to image analysis to obtain the droplet sizes. This procedure was evaluated by high-speed photography of droplets ejected at one particular experimental condition and these were image analysed. The correlations proposed in the literature to predict droplet sizes using ultrasound do not take into account all the relevant parameters. In this work, a truly universal correlation is proposed which accounts for the effects of physico-chemical properties of the liquid (flow rate, viscosity, density and surface tension), and ultrasonic properties like amplitude, frequency and the area of vibrating surface. The significant contribution of this work is to define dimensionless numbers incorporating ultrasonic parameters, taking cue from the conventional numbers that define the significance of different forces involved in droplet formation. The universal correlations proposed are robust and can be used for designing ultrasonic atomisers for different applications. Among the correlations proposed here, those ones that are based on the dimensionless numbers and Davies approach predict droplet sizes within acceptable limits of deviation. Also, an empirical correlation from experimental data has been proposed in this work.},

  abstract = {We investigate the atomization behavior of a droplet subjected to ultrasonic substrate vibration experimentally. High-speed imaging is employed to quantify the average atomization lifetime of the droplet as a function of initial droplet size and different fluid properties. Atomization rate increases with the initial droplet size and is also found to be very sensitive to changes in viscosity, while not so sensitive to surface tension changes. A theoretical model based on capillary wave breakup mechanism is developed, predicting these trends accurately. Our results underscore the role of capillary wave generation at the liquid-vapor interface via Faraday excitation in ultrasonic atomization. Though the capillary wavelength follows the inviscid scaling law, the wave breakup is shown to be controlled by a viscous-inertia balance.},

A bimodal distribution was obtained for the mist generated by ultrasonic atomization with a wide-range particle spectrometer. The peak diameter decreased with increasing frequency, and the number concentration of the mist increased in the smaller range. We determined the relation between the size distribution of the mist and the ultrasonic frequency, and we proposed a generation mechanism for the ultrasonic nanosized mist based on the amount of water vapor around the liquid column. Increasing the power intensity and density by changing the surface diameter of the ultrasonic oscillator affected the number concentration and size distribution of the nanosized mist. Using this technique, the diameter of the mist can be controlled by changing the frequency of the ultrasonic transducer.},

  title = {Measurement of Short-Term Nutrient Uptake Rates in Cranberry by Aeroponics},
  volume = {19},
  issn = {1365-3040},
  abstract = {Aeroponics, a soil-less plant culture system in which fresh nutrient solutions are intermittently or continuously misted on to plant roots, is capable of sustaining plant growth for extended periods of time while maintaining a constantly refreshed nutrient solution. Although used relatively extensively in commercial installations and in root physiology research, use of aeroponics in nutrient studies is rare. The object of this study was to examine whether nutrient uptake rates could be calculated for aeroponic systems by difference using measurements of concentrations and volumes of input and efflux solutions. Data were collected from an experiment with cranberry plants (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait. cv. Stevens) cultured aeroponically with nutrient solutions containing various concentrations of ammonium-N and isotopically labelled nitrate-N. Validation of the calculated uptake rates was sought by: (1) evaluating charge balance of the solutions and total ion uptake (including proton efflux) and (2) comparison with N-isotope measurements. Charge balance and proton efflux calculations required use of chemical modelling of the solutions to determine speciation of dissolved phosphate and acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC). The results show that charge balance requirements were acceptably satisfied for individual solution analyses and for total ion uptake when proton efflux was included. Relative rates of nitrate/ammonium uptake determined by difference were in agreement with those determined by isotopic techniques. Additional information was easily obtained from this experimental technique, including evidence of diurnal variation in nutrient uptake, correlation between ammonium uptake and proton efflux, and the relationship between ion concentration and uptake. Use of aeroponic systems for non-destructive measurement of water and ion uptake rates for numerous other species and nutrients appears promising.},

This article reviews the current practice and then theoretically and empirically examines several suitable tests. Based on that, we recommend a set of simple, yet safe and robust non-parametric tests for statistical comparisons of classifiers: the Wilcoxon signed ranks test for comparison of two classifiers and the Friedman test with the corresponding post-hoc tests for comparison of more classifiers over multiple data sets. Results of the latter can also be neatly presented with the newly introduced CD (critical difference) diagrams.},

JOSS is a free and open-access journal that publishes articles describing research software. It has the dual goals of improving the quality of the software submitted and providing a mechanism for research software developers to receive credit. While designed to work within the current merit system of science, JOSS addresses the dearth of rewards for key contributions to science made in the form of software. JOSS publishes articles that encapsulate scholarship contained in the software itself, and its rigorous peer review targets the software components: functionality, documentation, tests, continuous integration, and the license. A JOSS article contains an abstract describing the purpose and functionality of the software, references, and a link to the software archive. The article is the entry point of a JOSS submission, which encompasses the full set of software artifacts. Submission and review proceed in the open, on GitHub. Editors, reviewers, and authors work collaboratively and openly. Unlike other journals, JOSS does not reject articles requiring major revision; while not yet accepted, articles remain visible and under review until the authors make adequate changes (or withdraw, if unable to meet requirements). Once an article is accepted, JOSS gives it a digital object identifier (DOI), deposits its metadata in Crossref, and the article can begin collecting citations on indexers like Google Scholar and other services. Authors retain copyright of their JOSS article, releasing it under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. In its first year, starting in May 2016, JOSS published 111 articles, with more than 40 additional articles under review.
