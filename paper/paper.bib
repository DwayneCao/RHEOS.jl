  abstract = {Rheology is, by common consent, a difficult subject and some of the theoretical components are often viewed as being of prohibitive complexity by scientists without a strong mathematical background. There are also the difficulties inherent in any multidisciplinary science like rheology for those with a specific training. Therefore, newcomers to the field are sometimes discouraged, and for them the existing texts on the subject - some of which are outstanding - are of limited assistance because of their depth of detail and highly mathematical nature.This book introduces the subject of rheology in terms understandable to non-experts and describes the application of rheological principles to many industrial products and processes. It provides a simple but authoritative guide which shows clearly how mathematics, physics and chemistry have contributed to the development of rheology. The generic features of all liquid-like materials are summarised, i.e. viscosity, linear viscoelasticity, normal stresses and extensional viscosity. Particular systems are then discussed, i.e. polymeric liquids and suspensions. The final chapter gives an outline of the theoretical advances which have been made. Consistent notation and nomenclature have been used throughout the book, and the key textbooks and publications which will enable the reader to follow up particular topics are listed.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The mechanical response of single cells and tissues exhibits a broad distribution of time scales that gives often rise to a distinctive power-law regime. Such complex behaviour cannot be easily captured by traditional rheological approaches, making material characterisation and predictive modelling very challenging. Here, we present a novel model combining conventional viscoelastic elements with fractional calculus that successfully captures the macroscopic relaxation response of epithelial monolayers. The parameters extracted from the fitting of the relaxation modulus allow prediction of the response of the same material to slow stretch and creep, indicating that the model captured intrinsic material properties. Two characteristic times can be derived from the model parameters, and together these explain different qualitative behaviours observed in creep after genetic and chemical treatments. We compared the response of tissues with the behaviour of single cells as well as intra-cellular and extra-cellular components, and linked the power-law behaviour of the epithelium to the dynamics of the cell cortex. Such a unified model for the mechanical response of biological materials provides a novel and robust mathematical approach for diagnostic methods based on mechanical traits as well as more accurate computational models of tissues mechanics.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Pectin is a major component of the primary plant cell wall and is important for cell expansion. However, the relationship between its chemistry and mechanical properties is not fully understood, especially \emph{in vivo}. In this study, a protocol for viscoelastic micro-indentation using atomic force microscopy (AFM) was developed and applied to pectin \emph{in vitro} and \emph{in vivo}. After determining that linear viscoelasticity was a suitable theoretical framework for \emph{in vitro} pectin analyses were conducted with both a standard linear solid and fractional Zener model. These indicated a strong coupling between elastic and viscous properties over a range of degrees of methyl-esterification (DM). Both elasticity and viscosity were found to vary non-linearly with DM which had interesting consequences for pectin gels of mixed DM. In \emph{Arabidopsis} cell walls, the standard linear solid model was found to be appropriate. In this \emph{in vivo} composite material a weaker elastic-viscous coupling was exhibited, correlated with DM. The viscoelastic testing \emph{in vivo} of rapidly elongating cell walls, rich in high DM pectin, displayed a longer viscous time-scale. The implications of the testing method and results are discussed in the context of mechanobiology, mechano-chemistry, and cell growth.{$<$}/p{$>$}},
